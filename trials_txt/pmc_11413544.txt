Title: Ecological Momentary Intervention to Replace Sedentary Time With Physical Activity to Improve Executive Function in Midlife and Older Latino Adults: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial

Abstract: Exercise interventions often improve moderate to vigorous physical activity, but simultaneously increase sedentary time due to a compensatory resting response. A higher level of sedentary time is associated with a lower level of executive function, while increased moderate to vigorous physical activity is associated with improved global cognition and working memory among Latino adults. Latino adults are the fastest-growing minority group in the United States and are at high risk for cognitive decline, spend more time sedentary compared to non-Hispanic populations, and engage in low levels of physical activity. Interventions that are culturally appropriate for Latino adults to replace sedentary time with physical activity are critically needed. This study aims to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of an ecological momentary intervention (EMI; delivered in real time) that is individually designed to replace sedentary time with physical activity in Latino adults. This pilot study randomized 39 (n=26, 67% female; mean age 61, SD 5.8 years) community-dwelling, Spanish-speaking Latino adults (1:1 allocation) to either a 6-week EMI program designed to replace sitting time with physical activity (20/39, 51%) or physical activity guidelines education (19/39, 49%). The program was conducted on the web and in Spanish. The intervention was individualized based on individual interview responses. The intervention included the use of a Fitbit activity monitor, weekly didactic phone meetings, interactive tools (SMS text messages), and coach-delivered feedback. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed via study satisfaction (Likert scales), motivation (ecological momentary assessment), retention, and compliance. Sedentary time and physical activity were assessed via 7-day actigraphy. Cognitive performance was assessed via the trail making test part A and B (part B=executive function) and via the National Institutes of Health Toolbox remote cognitive assessment. Statistical analysis included a linear model on change score from baseline, adjusting for age, sex, and education, emphasizing effect size. Participant satisfaction with EMI was high (9.4/10), with a high degree of motivation to replace sitting time with physical activity (9.8/10). The intervention compliance rate was 79% with low difficulty using the Fitbit (1.7/10). Weekly step count increased in the intervention group by 5543 steps (group difference:  An individualized EMI designed for midlife and older Latino adults has the potential to replace sitting time with physical activity and improve executive functioning. The intervention was feasible and well received with a high degree of satisfaction. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04507464; https://tinyurl.com/44c4thk5

Introduction

The US population of adults aged â¥65 years is projected to increase from 58 million in 2021 to approximately 88 million by the year 2050 [
In addition, older Latino adults have a higher prevalence of risk factors for cognitive decline, and the rate of increase in risk factors is greatest among Latinos [
The current view of the field is rooted in a Eurocentric view, which assumes that interventions that work in one community will work the same in a different community. This assumption is likely incorrect and represents a significant gap in our ability to develop a successful intervention at the multiple levels that are required across the socioecological model (SEM) to be successful [
Following the NIH model stage 1A to 1B, this study aimed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a 6-week EMI program and explore effect sizes in the change in sedentary time, daily physical activity, and cognitive performance in midlife and older Latino adults, delivered in the home-setting over 6 weeks, compared to participants randomized to receive physical activity guidelines in Spanish. We hypothesized that the EMI program would be feasible and acceptable and that effect sizes would indicate plausibility of (1) reduced sedentary time (secondary outcome), (2) increased device-assessed daily physical activity (secondary outcome), and (3) improved cognitive performance (executive functioning and cognitive flexibility, and secondary outcome), compared to a group randomized to receive education on physical activity guidelines.

This Study
----------
Following the NIH model stage 1A to 1B, this study aimed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a 6-week EMI program and explore effect sizes in the change in sedentary time, daily physical activity, and cognitive performance in midlife and older Latino adults, delivered in the home-setting over 6 weeks, compared to participants randomized to receive physical activity guidelines in Spanish. We hypothesized that the EMI program would be feasible and acceptable and that effect sizes would indicate plausibility of (1) reduced sedentary time (secondary outcome), (2) increased device-assessed daily physical activity (secondary outcome), and (3) improved cognitive performance (executive functioning and cognitive flexibility, and secondary outcome), compared to a group randomized to receive education on physical activity guidelines.

Methods
-------
This study was a pilot of a 2-armed, parallel group randomized controlled trial. All procedures were conducted during COVID-19 restrictions between November 2020, and February 2022, remotely via telephone and videoconference. The principal investigator and assessor were blinded to group assignment. Research staff enrolled participants. Participants were randomized by the statistician using computerized variable block randomization of 2 and 4 as designed by the project statistician not involved in recruitment. All outcome assessments were conducted 1 week before randomization and 1 week following completion of the study period. Allocation was 1:1. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04507464) and reported in accordance with the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) 2010 statement: extension to randomized pilot and feasibility trials checklist [
A sample size of 12 per group is recommended for pilot studies estimating the mean and variability of continuous outcomes [
We recruited participants through flyers posted at local Latino-based organizations and on websites, as well as using word of mouth and through media advertisements. Investigators also gave Zoom presentations at several primarily Spanish-speaking churches to recruit additional participants in the Chicago area. We assessed 69 participants for eligibility.
Inclusion criteria were (1) being aged 55-89 years, (2) having no major head trauma, and (3) owning a working smartphone with internet and a messaging plan. Exclusion criteria were participating in a supervised exercise program, being wheelchair dependent, self-reporting a diagnosis of dementia, using medications to improve cognition or mood, and having contraindications to exercise per American College of Sports Medicine guidelines [
Participants were first screened to determine eligibility via telephone, and those who met the criteria completed the informed e-consent (in REDCap [Research Electronic Data Capture]; Vanderbilt University) conducted via Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc) video. Once consent was obtained, participants provided basic demographic information (age, sex, marital status, ethnicity, preferred language, and education) and a full medical history. We then completed the Charlson comorbidity questionnaire for each participant and conducted the following NIH Toolbox cognitive function measures as approved by the NIH for use via video call [
Following cognitive function testing, we conducted a video interview using Zoom or Teams (Microsoft Corp), which was recorded, transcribed, and translated for the development of an individualized, culturally tailored EMI program (see the Intervention section for details). Once participants completed the interviews, they were mailed a triaxial accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X+, ActiGraph), which they were instructed to wear on their right hip and waist for 7 consecutive days to measure sedentary time and daily physical activity. Upon return of the ActiGraph, participants were randomized and notified of their assigned group (EMI or physical activity guideline education). The accelerometer was worn by both groups at baseline and at follow-up. Data collectors instructed the participants on the use of the accelerometer and the use of an accelerometer log.
The primary outcome measures were feasibility and acceptability. Study feasibility and acceptability measures were assessed by study satisfaction debriefing at the end of the study via 10-point Likert scales. Satisfaction Likert scales were as follows: (1) How satisfied were you with the program? (0=not satisfied-10=extremely satisfied), (2) Did Fitbit motivate you to exercise? (0=not helpful-10=extremely helpful), (3) Did you enjoy the physical activity options provided by SMS text message? (0=not at all-10=very much), and (4) Did you have difficulty using Fitbit and the app? (0=no difficultly-10=very much difficulty). We further asked an open-ended question, Is there anything you would like us to know about the program that is good or that we should improve? (sample quotes are provided in 
Intervention delivery, feasibility, and acceptability were measured via ecological momentary assessment (EMA) during the course of the intervention period using 10-point Likert scales. EMA assessment provided real-time feedback 3 times per day during the study following SMS text message prompts using several Likert scales: (1) Did the SMS text message motivate you to exercise? (0=not at all-10=very much), (2) Did you enjoy the SMS text message prompt? (0=not at all-10=very much), (3) Did you have difficulty with understanding the SMS text message? (0=no difficulty-10=very much difficulty), and (4) Did the SMS text message help you with the Fitbit? (0=not at all-10=very much). Acceptability and feasibility of the intervention delivery were defined as 70% of participants rating >8/10 on study satisfaction and <2/10 on difficulties in the EMA Likert scale measures based on consensus and previous research in the Bronas laboratory.
Feasibility was further defined as a participant retention rate of >80%, a compliance rate to the intervention of >70% (defined as <70% of time spent sedentary or at least 150 min of moderate physical activity per week), and a wear time of activity tracking devices >80%. Compliance was assessed using the Fitbit to assess the fidelity of treatment. All outcome measures were obtained at baseline 1 week before randomization and 1 week after completion of the study period. To analyze data obtained from the individual phone interviews, we conducted a thematic analysis to explore themes. The thematic analysis will provide a deeper understanding of physical, psychological, and social influences that influence physical activity choices in midlife and older Latino adults. Understanding these factors will be crucial for the continued refinement of effective interventions.
Baseline demographics.
The secondary outcome measures included sedentary time and cognitive function. Sedentary time, measured using the ActiGraph, was defined as an awake activity with an energy expenditure â¤1.5 metabolic equivalents occurring in a sitting or reclining posture, vector magnitude counts of <70 counts/15 seconds, and vertical axis counts of <10 counts/15 seconds. The sedentary interruption was defined as counts >100/minute. Nonwear time was considered as 60 minutes of 0-activity counts. Any counts >15,000 were considered erroneous [
The EMI program was developed based on the principles of the SEM, by understanding and considering participantsâ individual cultural interaction with their living environment [
Participants in the EMI group were mailed a Fitbit Charge 4 activity monitor, and a research assistant helped them to set it up via Zoom and configure it to receive sedentary behavior notifications in the form of vibrations when a participant walked <250 steps per hour during waking hours (lowest setting available for the Fitbit; waking hours were selected by the participant). We then scheduled a video call to set up a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Actâcompliant EMA system (Ilumivu mEMA [Ilumivu Inc]) and provided education about Fitbit and the intervention to disrupt sedentary time. Through the use of the Fitbit activity tracker and SMS text messages, we were able to implement real-time delivery of the behavior options, and the Ilumivu mEMA [
Participants received a message about the success of positive choices for behavioral action. The resulting actions and delivery success of the intervention were automatically captured and downloaded in real time using iCardia and the Ilumivu mEMA smartphone app. Participants randomized to the control group were sent and received an hour-long video education on general physical activity guidelines (questions were entertained and answered). The control group was called weekly to keep them engaged in the study, but due to the limited nature of the pilot study, they did not receive a Fitbit, and thus, this was not a true attention control group. After the completion of the 6-week intervention period, all participants were again mailed an ActiGraph to be worn on the waist for 7 days to measure sedentary time and daily physical activity. Once the ActiGraph was mailed back, a phone interview was scheduled with each participant to understand where they had difficulty and what aspects of the program did or did not work for them. The cognitive function tests administered at baseline were then repeated.
This was a pilot randomized controlled trial for feasibility, acceptability, and to determine preliminary effect sizes. Therefore, we emphasized descriptive statistics, such as means, SDs, frequencies, percentages, and effect sizes, to demonstrate the feasibility of recruitment, compliance, retention, treatment effects over time, and proof of concept. In addition, 2-sample

Discussion
----------
This study investigated the feasibility and acceptability of an individualized cultural EMI program for breaking up and replacing sedentary time (sitting) with physical activity on cognitive performance in older Latino adults with Spanish-speaking preference. We were able to recruit a representative sample using virtual recruitment strategies indicating that our recruitment methods were successful and that future findings will be generalizable. A high percentage (39/50, 78%) of eligible participants enrolled in the study, and we observed a low (1/39, 3%) percentage of loss to follow-up. We had no missing outcome data, and we demonstrated success in our intervention delivery with 100% of SMS text messages being received. Compliance was high, and participants indicated a high degree of satisfaction, motivation, and no difficulties with study instruments, suggesting acceptability of the study. In support of our hypotheses, the intervention program was feasible and acceptable. In this pilot, we further observed a high degree of compliance with the EMI, which showed a promising trend for decreasing sedentary time and a trend for increasing physical activity in the EMI group, compared to the physical activity guidelines group. Although underpowered, we observed moderate effect sizes indicating the plausibility of EMI decreasing sedentary time and replacing it with physical activity. This is in contrast with the study by Hartman et al [
Importantly, by replacing sedentary time with a mixture of low-intensity physical activity (+27.6 min), and MVPA (+51.6 min), it is possible that exercise-induced cardiometabolic risk factors decreased [
Although the study was underpowered, we observed a significant increase in executive function as measured by TMT-B time to completion and a reduction in errors when completing the TMT-B in the intervention group compared to the control group. In addition, there were trends for nonsignificant improvements in oral reading recognition and crystallized cognition scores from baseline in the intervention group with modest effect sizes similar to other exercise studies in primarily White populations [
These results indicate the plausibility of an individualized EMI program designed for midlife and older Latino adults to be successful in replacing sitting time with light activity and MVPA and improving executive function. These findings need to be confirmed in a larger and fully powered efficacy trial. Exploratory analyses suggest that the observed improvement in executive function could potentially be mediated via a combination of reduced sedentary time and increased MVPA. These findings are important since older Latino adults in the United States will comprise a significant proportion of the overall population in the coming decades. This, in addition to the disproportionate risk for ADRD among this group, presents the need for individually and culturally tailored interventions to promote health and reduce the risk of cognitive decline. These findings need to be assessed in a larger sample designed to test efficacy. Importantly, any physical activity intervention needs to be sustainable in the long term and in the community. Although we did not assess sustainability in this study, it is plausible that an EMI program has the potential to translate into long-term behavior change using the principles of SEM. The results associated with our outcome measures, in conjunction with findings from the participant satisfaction survey, indicate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary plausibility of an individualized culturally tailored EMI for improving sedentary behaviors within the Latino population.
The strengths of this study included the randomized controlled design and a high rate of compliance associated with the intervention. This allowed for optimal delivery of motivational messages as well as reliable and consistent data collection via the iCardia platform. This was an entirely virtual intervention suggesting that we can avoid the requirement of in-person attendance, and therefore, increase our ability to reach working adults and adults that may not have the means to participate in-person.

The small sample size and ratio of male-to-female participants reduced the generalizability of our findings. The sample consisted of only midlife and older Latino adults from Chicago.

The intervention period was short due to the proof-of-concept nature of the study, but we used alternative forms of cognitive function assessment when available to control possible learning effects. A larger and longer duration study is needed, including a sustainability period. Due to the nature of the pilot study, we were unable to provide Fitbits to the control group, which may have confounded the outcomes due to motivation. In addition, restrictions in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic prevented us from performing additional procedures that could have further validated our findings. For example, we were limited to performing cognitive testing from the NIH Toolbox that was approved for virtual administration only. However, this study would have benefitted from administering motor function testing and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain at baseline and follow-up to fully evaluate changes to functional connectivity networks. In the future, our team plans to improve the representation of the study sample by expanding to include more males. We will also seek to conduct more detailed connectivity analyses, examine the duration of treatment effects over time, and examine mediators and moderators of mechanisms of action.
In sum, this study fills a critical gap in the literature by addressing the need to determine aspects of interventional programs that show promise to fit the needs of the Latino older adult community. The EMI program was feasible and acceptable. This was accomplished through the use of an EMI designed to deliver content in real time, and in the real-world environment. The design and methods of the intervention enabled real-time delivery of behavior options and real-time feedback on the effectiveness of behavior choices. This allowed us to create an individual and culturally tailored intervention that was based on preferences of individuals within their community networks. The results presented in this paper can be used to support the design of future physical activity interventions targeted to forestall or prevent cognitive decline in this population and inform improvements in the design and implementation of meaningful interventions that are culturally appropriate and relevant to the needs of the aging Latino population in the United States. It is especially important to develop physical activity interventions that not only increase physical activity but also reduce sedentary time. These interventions need to be sustainable and targeted to disenfranchised and marginalized populations who may not speak or prefer English and who have disadvantaged socioeconomic status. The EMI program shows promise in meeting this critical need.
An EMI program designed to replace sedentary time with physical activity is feasible and acceptable. The effect sizes suggest plausibility that a 6-week EMI program can replace sitting time with physical activity and improve executive functioning in older Latino adults. It is plausible that the improvement in executive function is related to a combination of reduced sedentary time and increased MVPA. The clinical implication of our work remains to be further explored.

Principal Findings
------------------
This study investigated the feasibility and acceptability of an individualized cultural EMI program for breaking up and replacing sedentary time (sitting) with physical activity on cognitive performance in older Latino adults with Spanish-speaking preference. We were able to recruit a representative sample using virtual recruitment strategies indicating that our recruitment methods were successful and that future findings will be generalizable. A high percentage (39/50, 78%) of eligible participants enrolled in the study, and we observed a low (1/39, 3%) percentage of loss to follow-up. We had no missing outcome data, and we demonstrated success in our intervention delivery with 100% of SMS text messages being received. Compliance was high, and participants indicated a high degree of satisfaction, motivation, and no difficulties with study instruments, suggesting acceptability of the study. In support of our hypotheses, the intervention program was feasible and acceptable. In this pilot, we further observed a high degree of compliance with the EMI, which showed a promising trend for decreasing sedentary time and a trend for increasing physical activity in the EMI group, compared to the physical activity guidelines group. Although underpowered, we observed moderate effect sizes indicating the plausibility of EMI decreasing sedentary time and replacing it with physical activity. This is in contrast with the study by Hartman et al [
Importantly, by replacing sedentary time with a mixture of low-intensity physical activity (+27.6 min), and MVPA (+51.6 min), it is possible that exercise-induced cardiometabolic risk factors decreased [
Although the study was underpowered, we observed a significant increase in executive function as measured by TMT-B time to completion and a reduction in errors when completing the TMT-B in the intervention group compared to the control group. In addition, there were trends for nonsignificant improvements in oral reading recognition and crystallized cognition scores from baseline in the intervention group with modest effect sizes similar to other exercise studies in primarily White populations [
These results indicate the plausibility of an individualized EMI program designed for midlife and older Latino adults to be successful in replacing sitting time with light activity and MVPA and improving executive function. These findings need to be confirmed in a larger and fully powered efficacy trial. Exploratory analyses suggest that the observed improvement in executive function could potentially be mediated via a combination of reduced sedentary time and increased MVPA. These findings are important since older Latino adults in the United States will comprise a significant proportion of the overall population in the coming decades. This, in addition to the disproportionate risk for ADRD among this group, presents the need for individually and culturally tailored interventions to promote health and reduce the risk of cognitive decline. These findings need to be assessed in a larger sample designed to test efficacy. Importantly, any physical activity intervention needs to be sustainable in the long term and in the community. Although we did not assess sustainability in this study, it is plausible that an EMI program has the potential to translate into long-term behavior change using the principles of SEM. The results associated with our outcome measures, in conjunction with findings from the participant satisfaction survey, indicate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary plausibility of an individualized culturally tailored EMI for improving sedentary behaviors within the Latino population.
