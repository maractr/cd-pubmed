Title: Effect of kaempferol ingestion on physical activity and sleep quality: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover trial

Abstract: Kaempferol (KMP), a flavonoid in edible plants, exhibits diverse pharmacological effects. Growing body of evidence associates extended lifespan with physical activity (PA) and sleep, but KMPâs impact on these behaviors is unclear. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial assessed KMPâs effects on PA and sleep. A total of 33 city workers (17 males and 16 females) participated in this study. They were randomly assigned to take either 10âmg of KMP or placebo for 2 weeks in the order allocated, with a 7-day washout period in between. All participants wore an accelerometer-based wearable device (Fitbit Charge 4), which monitored daily PA, heart rate (HR), and HR variability during sleep. The duration of wearing the device was 23.73âÂ±â0.04âh/day. HR decreased in each PA level, and the mean daily step count and distance covered increased significantly during KMP intake compared to placebo. The outing rate, number of trips, number of recreational activities, and time spent in recreation on weekends increased. Sleep quality improved following KMP intake. The decrease in HR and increase in RMSSD may be important in mediating the effects of these KMPs. KMP leads to behavioral changes that subsequently improve sleep quality and potentially improve long-term quality of life.

Materials and methods
---------------------
Ethical considerations were strictly adhered to during this study, following the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. All procedures involving human subjects were approved by the Ethics Committee of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (approval no. 2003, dated October 30, 2020).
This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study, was conducted at Saga Nutraceuticals Research Institute, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. between November 2020 and December 2020. Thirty-seven untrained city workers recruited through advertisements using flyers and over email participated in the study. Written informed consent for participation and publication of the data was obtained from each participant after providing a comprehensive explanation of the experimental procedures and associated risks.
Participants visited the laboratory before the supplementation period in the two-week selection period. During this visit, their medical histories were recorded, and they underwent physical examinations, biochemical blood tests, and hematological tests, allowing physicians to assess potential health risks and chronic diseases. Participants consumed 10âmg KMP supplement and a 24âh urine collection was performed to evaluate the urinary excretion of KMP.
Based on these results, we excluded participants with digestive, circulatory, or endocrine diseases, those using medication for treatment, those having food allergies, pregnant women, or those deemed ineligible for this study by a medical doctor. Thirty-four participants proceeded to the double-blind supplementation phase. The random assignment was performed by a person blinded to this studyâs conduct and analysis. Random allocation to the two groups, placebo start and KMP start, was performed using the permuted block method (block size of four) by entering the described variables (age, sex, and body mass index) into the SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, United States) in a 1:1 ratio. This facilitated an automatic allocation and generated a unique ID code for each participant. The personnel administering test foods to the participants differed from those performing experiments and analyzing data, ensuring blinding of the staff involved in analyses to the test foods administered to the participants.
During the supplementation period, participants consumed either a granulated formulation containing 10âmg of KMP or a placebo granulate, designed as isocaloric, every day after breakfast for 2âweeks, with a 7-day washout period in between. Throughout this period, various parameters, such as PA levels, heart rate, and sleep indices were monitored using the Fitbit Charge 4 device. Participants maintained a diary detailing their physical condition, PA, and specifics of supplement intake. A schematic of the study design is shown in 
Schematic illustration of the crossover design of the study.
Each participant received a Fitbit Charge 4 tracker to wear on their non-dominant hand for the study. Detailed instructions on proper device use and mobile application installation according to the manufacturerâs specifications were provided. Additionally, participants were trained on the periodic synchronization of their Fitbit tracker to ensure accurate data recording and monitoring throughout the study.
Parameters related to PA (step count, walking and running distance, metabolic equivalent of task [MET], GPS position) and HR measurements were directly downloaded from the web server using a developerâs application programming interface (API) provided by Fitbit. This API facilitated the direct extraction of data from the Fitbit web server. The non-wear time was defined as 120 or more consecutive minutes with zero steps counted. All other time intervals were categorized as wear time (
The PA levels were categorized as rest (<1.5 METs), light (1.5â2.9 METs), moderate (3â5.9 METs), and vigorous (>6 METs) from the data obtained from Fitbit. PA level and HR at each intensity were computed, and HR-MET curves were generated for each supplement intake using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, United States). The minute-by-minute GPS data downloaded from the Fitbit application was imported into QGIS (QGIS Geographic Information System. Open Source Geospatial Foundation Project. 
The participants recorded their in-home and out-of-home daily activities (such as shopping, recreation, exercise, jog-related activities, housework, rest, and sleep) in a logbook. The accuracy of the information recorded in the logbook was cross-referenced with the GPS coordinates of the activity locations at the end of the study. The percentage of participants making at least one trip per day (outing rate), number of trips, number of recreational activities, and time spent on recreation on weekends were calculated.
Urine analysis involved mixing 100âÎ¼L of each sample with 100âÎ¼L (50âunits) of Î²-glucuronidase solution (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) in 0.2âM sodium acetate buffer (Wako Pure Chemicals Industries Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), pH 5.0. The mixture was incubated at 37Â°C for 30âmin, followed by the addition of 200âÎ¼L of 4% phosphate buffer containing internal standard, apigenin-d5 (Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc., North York, ON, Canada).
The prepared urine samples were transferred to a conditioned 96-well Oasis MCX Î¼Elution plate (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, United States), passed through the sorbent bed, and washed with 200âÎ¼L of 2% formic acid (Wako Pure Chemicals Industries Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in water, followed by 200âÎ¼L of 40% methanol (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, United States). KMP and the internal standard were eluted with 150âÎ¼L methanol/acetonitrile (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, United States) in another 96-well elution plate for final analysis. Chromatographic separation involved injecting 20âÎ¼L of the prepared sample into a reverse-phased C18 analytical column (50âmmâÃâ2âmm, 3âÎ¼m particle size, Cadenza CD-C18, Imtakt Co., Kyoto, Japan). We achieved high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) separation on a Shiseido Nanospace HPLC system (Tokyo, Japan). The mobile phase comprised 0.1% formic acid with water and acetonitrile, and operated at a flow rate of 0.35âmL/min. The chromatographic conditions were held constant at the initial mobile phase composition (20% acetonitrile) for 0.5âmin, followed by a linear gradient to 95% acetonitrile for 2âmin, maintained at 95% acetonitrile for 3.5âmin, followed by a linear gradient to 20% acetonitrile for 3.6âmin, and maintained a 20% acetonitrile for 5.5âmin. The HPLC-separated samples were analyzed using a Sciex API-3000 tandem mass spectrometer (Sciex, Framingham, MA, United States) equipped with a Turbo Ion Spray interface.
All data are presented as the meanâÂ±âstandard error of the mean. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.4), R (version 4.3.3) with packages âbeeswarmâ and âcorrplot,â and Python (version 3.10). A 
PCA (principal component analysis) was performed using standardized data on 18 indicators, including daily step count; moving distance; total METs; total-, interrupted-, rem-. light-, and deep-sleep times; sleep score; daily, rest, light, middle, and vigorous activities; sleep-HR; RMSSD; and LF/HF. The missing data were complemented by the values calculated by applying default parameters with the KNNImputer of sci-kit-learn (v1.2.2). The differences in principal component scores (PC1 and PC2) between placebo and KMP were calculated, and the cosine similarity with the principal component loadings of each variable was calculated.
Spearman correlation analysis for effects due to KMP intake was performed between the change in the 18 indicators (Îâ=âKMP â Placebo) and KMP absorbability.
Spearman correlation analysis for each indicator was performed using data for the 19 parameters, including 18 indicators and KMP absorbability for placebo and KMP groups. KMP absorbability in the placebo group was set to 0.

Discussion
----------
Daily intake of KMP improved both PA and sleep quality. Regular PA is associated with a reduction in mortality and the risk of chronic diseases (
By incorporating KMP intake into daily life without restricting everyday activities, we observed a decrease in HR across all PA levels and an increase in step counts and visual behavioral volumes as shown by the heatmaps. These results are similar to previous survey findings that daily PA increases email and web-based interventions (
Even light exercises such as walking or bicycling, when continued, prevent diseases and reduce all-cause mortality rates (
HR variability affects PA levels and sleep quality. For example, a lower HR during sleep is associated with improved autonomic function and better sleep quality (
There are several potential mechanisms that could lead to improved sleep quality. Dworak et al. reported a positive correlation between deep sleep and brain ATP content (
PCA showed that KMP intake exerts similar effects in participants with variable backgrounds, reinforcing the potential for KMPâs effects to be generalized and widely applied. The changes from placebo to KMP were characterized by RMSSD. However, as mentioned below, the action of KMP on RMSSD may be indirect owing to the increase in PA. Therefore, the effects of food ingredients such as KMP, unlike those of highly selective drugs, are non-selective actions that broadly affect our bodies, yielding various health benefits.
We conducted a correlation analysis between the change in indicators due to KMP intake to understand the overall effects of KMP and predict its mechanism. The ÎPA level correlated with the absorbability of KMP, suggesting that the absorbability of KMP is likely to be directly involved in the mechanism that improved the PA levels. Therefore, enhancing the bioavailability of KMP could lead to an increase in daily PA levels.
While the sleep score and RMSSD in the KMP group were significantly higher than those in the placebo group, there was no correlation between Îsleep score and ÎRMSSD and absorbability of KMP, suggesting that the effects of KMP on sleep score and RMSSD could be exerted âregardless of the level of absorbability,â or through a âpathway driven by low blood concentration,â or âindirectly such as through metabolically converted components,â or through a âchange in PA levels.â The Îdaily step count correlated positively with Îdeep-sleep time. KMP intake did not affect the average sleep time of the whole group but affected the deep-sleep time in individuals who showed changes in PA levels, i.e., those with high absorbability of KMP. These factors show a complex relationship and are presumed to affect sleep quality. Interestingly, ÎRMSSD, which characterizes the change from placebo to KMP, showed a sufficient correlation with ÎHR, suggesting the importance of the relationship between these two indicators. In the correlational analysis combining data from the placebo and KMP groups, a strong inverse correlation was found between RMSSD and HR, suggesting that the decrease in HR and increase in RMSSD are core factors underlying the effects of KMP.
Hypoxia is a lethal risk to the survival of living organisms and causes energy deficiency. To address hypoxia, the body increases respiratory rate and HR, along with pulmonary artery constriction and HIF activation (
Environmental stresses, including ultraviolet exposure, increase the content of KMP in plants (
Flavonoids, including KMPs, generally found in plants, exist as glycosides, and they might not be absorbed even when ingested. The test food we used in this study is easily absorbable, having converted KMP glycoside into aglycone using a unique method. A positive correlation was observed between ÎPA levels and the absorbability of KMP, indicating that providing food containing easily absorbable KMP is important for increasing PA levels and, ultimately, promoting health.
Nagano Prefecture, the site of our study, has a large population of long-lived individuals and an average altitude of over 1,000âm. During the placebo intake period, participantsâ mean number of steps per day exceeded 10,000. These participants may contribute to their daily PA and enhance oxygen utilization efficiency by regularly consuming vegetables cultivated at high altitudes.
This study has some limitations that must be addressed. First, the city workers who participated in this study were a group without exercise habits but achieved an average of 10,000 steps per day. The effects of KMP in people with average or below-average exercise habits need further investigation to confirm these results in individuals with low PA levels. Second, this study investigated whether PA changes occurred only when KMP was ingested, without limiting daily activities. Although PA levels increased, future studies need to confirm that this was not correlated with the ingestion of other supplements that may increase PA. Third, subjective assessments may be more important than objective assessments for sleep (

Conclusion
----------
The daily intake of KMP leads to behavioral changes, including an increase in PA and the number of outings on weekends, which subsequently improve sleep quality. Furthermore, we have elucidated the relationship between PA and sleep. The associated decrease in HR and regulation of the autonomic nervous system may have played important roles in these changes. Generally, the effects of food are not as potent as those of pharmaceuticals; however, KMP could potentially be used as a food ingredient that can help maintain the quality of life for people living in the era of a 100-year lifespan, considering that it can be ingested daily. Future research should focus on elucidating the detailed molecular mechanisms of KMP, and its potential contribution to the lives of people with diverse backgrounds.
