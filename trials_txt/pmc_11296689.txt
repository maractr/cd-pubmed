Title: Feasibility of wearable sensor signals and self-reported symptoms to prompt at-home testing for acute respiratory viruses in the USA (DETECT-AHEAD): a decentralised, randomised controlled trial

Abstract: Early identification of an acute respiratory infection is important for reducing transmission and enabling earlier therapeutic intervention. We aimed to prospectively evaluate the feasibility of home-based diagnostic self-testing of viral pathogens in individuals prompted to do so on the basis of self-reported symptoms or individual changes in physiological parameters detected via a wearable sensor. DETECT-AHEAD was a prospective, decentralised, randomised controlled trial carried out in a subpopulation of an existing cohort (DETECT) of individuals enrolled in a digital-only observational study in the USA. Participants aged 18 years or older were randomly assigned (1:1:1) with a block randomisation scheme stratified by under-represented in biomedical research status. All participants were offered a wearable sensor (Fitbit Sense smartwatch). Participants in groups 1 and 2 received an at-home self-test kit (Alveo be.well) for two acute respiratory viral pathogens: SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus. Participants in group 1 could be alerted through the DETECT study app to take the at-home test on the basis of changes in their physiological data (as detected by our algorithm) or due to self-reported symptoms; those in group 2 were prompted via the app to self-test only due to symptoms. Group 3 served as the control group, without alerts or home testing capability. The primary endpoints, assessed on an intention-to-treat basis, were the number of acute respiratory infections presented (self-reported) and diagnosed (electronic health record), and the number of participants using at-home testing in groups 1 and 2. This trial is registered with  Between Sept 28 and Dec 30, 2021, 450 participants were recruited and randomly assigned to group 1 (n=149), group 2 (n=151), or group 3 (n=150). 179 (40%) participants were male, 264 (59%) were female, and seven (2%) identified as other. 232 (52%) were from populations historically under-represented in biomedical research. 118 (39%) of the 300 participants in groups 1 and 2 were prompted to self-test, with 61 (52%) successfully completing self-testing. Participants were prompted to home-test more frequently due to symptoms (41 [28%] in group 1 and 51 [34%] in group 2) than due to detected physiological changes (26 [17%] in group 1). Significantly more participants in group 1 received alerts to test than did those in group 2 (67 [45%]  In this direct-to-participant trial, we showed early feasibility of a decentralised programme to prompt individuals to use a viral pathogen diagnostic test based on symptoms tracked in the study app or physiological changes detected using a wearable sensor.

Introduction
------------
To limit transmission of pathogens that cause acute respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus, the early identification of infected individuals is crucial. During the COVID-19 pandemic, several possible solutions were identified, including the use of self-reported symptoms
Home-based self-testing for viral pathogens was essentially non-existent before COVID-19. However, as the pandemic evolved, dozens of home tests received regulatory emergency use authorisation,
Early diagnosis of acute respiratory infection is also a substantial challenge in clinical research. The traditional approach to the conduct of clinical trials for prevention of acute respiratory infections relies on a centralised approach to the identification of clinically relevant events, which is subject to underdiagnosis and missing data. Development and implementation of a digital platform, enabling early viral pathogen diagnosis and monitoring of patients with acute respiratory infections in a real-world environment in the context of a clinical trial, might address these crucial challenges.
We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of combining two novel technologies developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemicâa closed-loop digital program built around novel at-home viral diagnostic testing coupled with an algorithm-based alert system using wearable sensor data and mobile app symptom monitoringâthat could enable the early diagnosis of viral respiratory infections in a real-world environment.

Methods
-------
DETECT At-Home Early Alert and Diagnosis (DETECT-AHEAD) was a prospective, decentralised, randomised controlled trial done in a subpopulation of an existing cohort of individuals enrolled in a nationwide, digital-only observational study in the USA.
The study population was composed of individuals who had previously consented to enrol in the DETECT study.
DETECT participants were invited by email to open the MyDataHelps app then, in the app, they could verify if they were eligible for the DETECT-AHEAD substudy. The substudy prioritised enrolment of individuals historically under-represented in biomedical research (UBR), which was previously defined across several diversity categories.
Individuals who consented to enrol in DETECT-AHEAD had previously consented as participants in the larger DETECT study. All those participating in the DETECT-AHEAD substudy provided additional signed informed consent electronically. The protocol for DETECT-AHEAD was reviewed and approved by the Scripps Office for the Protection of Research Subjects (IRB 20â7531). This trial is registered with 
Consented participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) into three groups (two interventional groups and one observational group) stratified by UBR status. Randomisation was conducted by the study clinical biostatistician using a random number generator with permuted block sizes of 3 and 6.
All participants were given free access to a Fitbit Sense smartwatch (Fitbit, San Francisco, CA, USA) and the MyDataHelps app with the DETECT-AHEAD substudy. Those assigned to the interventional groups (groups 1 and 2) also received the Alveo be.well home molecular testing kit (Alveo Technologies, Alameda, CA, USA), which was designed to test for SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus. These pathogens were selected by the manufacturer of the kit due to their high incidence and potential severity. All participants could visualise their own biometrics as routinely provided by the smartwatch, which they were asked to wear as much as possible, including while sleeping. All participants were asked to complete respiratory symptom surveys on the downloaded mobile app if they developed any symptom.
Participants assigned to group 1 could be alerted to self-test at most once, either by an algorithm that computed an anomaly score based on physiological sensor data
The measured values of resting heart rate, sleep duration, and activity (measured as steps) collected by Fitbit Sense were used each day to calculate a risk score for infection. This risk assessment was based on the adaptation of an algorithm for detection of COVID-19, which has been shown previously to provide a positive predictive value of 0Â·50 and negative predictive value of 0Â·90 based on deviations from an individualâs baseline (with baseline calculated on the basis of at least 27 days of the wearerâs 60 days of data before the day of interest, but excluding the 6 days immediately before).
To capture positive cases with a minimal delay after infection, the physiological alert was activated when the risk simultaneously exceeded the predefined threshold for resting heart rate and for at least one of sleep or activity. This system, which triggered an alert only when at least two physiological signals exceeded their threshold, was designed to limit the number of false positives, since by design each individual could be alerted only once during the study period.
The Alveo be.well at-home diagnostic test enables molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus at home.
If and when participants developed symptoms suggestive of a possible acute respiratory infection, they were asked to document the presence of specific symptoms on a daily basis until they resolved. Participants in groups 1 and 2 were alerted to test with the Alveo be.well kit if their symptom score met prespecified criteria (
A usability survey created for this study was provided after a participant used the be.well kit. This survey asked about ease of use, comfort level of the nasal swab and self-administration, clarity of instructions, and overall experience (
A behaviour survey, also created for this study, administered to obtain information about participantsâ behaviour around the time of the alert, was delivered after results of the Alveo test were returned to participants. Behaviour questions included how the alert affected their actions, if any, before and after being prompted to test, including isolation, care seeking, and taking time off work. We also asked the participants to speculate whether or not immediate return of test results would have affected their care seeking or isolation (
The primary endpoints were the number of acute respiratory infections presented (self-reported) and diagnosed (electronic health record), and the number of participants using at-home testing. Secondary endpoints reported here were the number of positive, negative, and null tests, and the corresponding percentages over the total number of tests, and the usability of the at-home tests.
Some endpoints initially specified in the protocol could not be measured due to limitations in availability of linked electronic health record data. We were unaware of these limitations until carrying out the study. It was not possible to establish acute respiratory infection presentation for individuals in group 3 who did not have a clinical visit reported in the electronic health record. It was also not possible to collect the difference in days of symptoms from initial detection to contact with a medical provider, nor correlation of sensor data with symptom severity, as it was not possible to consistently assess duration and severity of symptoms. Changes in medications used for chronic conditions were not assessed. Finally, a planned substudy including behavioural testing of study platform communications was not implemented. A study coordinator at Scripps Research was responsible for recording adverse events.
In this descriptive feasibility trial, a convenience sample of 450 participants was determined empirically to provide adequate sample size for real-word usability and feasibility data, based on the investigatorsâ previous experience with direct-to-participants studies using novel digital devices. The number of participants was calculated by setting the dropout or loss to follow-up to 10% (estimated from previous related studies
The objective was to assess the feasibility and usability of the multiple interconnected components of this digital technology-enabled decentralised trial. Therefore, the analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. We calculated the ratio of individuals alerted to test and who completed the symptom survey among the 450 individuals in the three groups or individuals in a specific group. Comparisons between the two interventional groups were also tested for statistical significance (ie, p value <0Â·05) with standard two-tailed Ï
Researchers employed by the funder of the study participated in study design and data collection, but they did not have access to the raw data and had no role in data analysis; they did contribute to data interpretation and writing of the report.

Results
-------
Between Sept 28 and Dec 30, 2021, 450 participants were recruited and randomly assigned to group 1 (n=149), group 2 (n=151), or group 3 (n=150; 
Over the study period, 118 (39%) of the 300 participants in groups 1 and 2 were prompted to self-test. More participants in group 1 received alerts to test (67 [45%] of 149) than did those in group 2 (51 [34%] of 151; p=0Â·047; 
Following prompting, 61 (52%) of 118 individuals successfully completed self-testing. In group 1, 29 (43%) of 67 individuals who were alerted performed the at-home test, with a marked difference in testing rates based on what triggered the alert: six (23%) of 26 participants completed self-testing after physiological alerts and 23 (56%) of 41 did so after symptom alerts. 32 (63%) of 51 participants in group 2 completed their home test after being alerted, significantly more than in group 1 (p=0Â·036). Among the 61 people who tested after receiving an alert, 19 (31%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (eight [28%] in group 1 and 11 [34%] in group 2), none tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus, 24 (39%) tested negative for both (13 [45%] in group 1 and 11 [34%] in group 2), and 18 (30%) obtained an invalid result (eight [28%] in group 1 and ten [31%] in group 2; 
Almost as many participants (n=60; 28 [19%] from group 1 and 32 [21%] from group 2) self-tested spontaneously (unrelated to being alerted) as those who were alerted (
Of 26 participants who received an alert to test based on physiological changes, 17 (65%) never reported any symptoms. Eight (31%) participants with a physiological alert reported symptoms in the 7 days (median 3Â·00 days [IQR 0Â·75â5Â·00]) after the alert (
All participants agreed to share their electronic health record data. At least one electronic health record entry was available for 444 (99%) of 450 individuals. 238 (53%) had at least one encounter within the health-care system entered in their electronic health record since enrolment in DETECT-AHEAD (
For all three participants who received an alert and tested at home, and had an electronic health record encounter within 2 weeks after that event, the home test was concordant with the electronic health record result (both positive for two participants, both negative for one participant). No acute respiratory infection-related hospitalisations were reported in the electronic health records.
Of the 450 participants who were offered a smartwatch at no cost, 399 (89%) ordered the device and 372 (83%) connected its data to the study platform. Of these 372 participants, 300 (81%) used the device consistently throughout the trial, defined as wearing it for at least 6 h per day on at least 95% of the study days. 292 (78%) participants wore the device for at least 10 h per day for 95% of the study days. The wearing time was determined by the presence of heart rate signal. Among the 372 participants who connected the wearable data, 162 (44%) were considered to be UBR, of whom 131 (81%) used the device consistently for at least 6 h per day.
The usability survey was provided to the 121 individuals who used the at-home test kit and was completed by 89 (74%) participants. 73 (82%) participants confirmed the ease of use of the test and 78 (88%) confirmed a high comfort level of the nasal swab. Among the individuals who answered the survey, 65 (73%) would recommend this test (
The behaviour survey was also delivered to the 121 participants who completed an at-home test, and was completed by 51 (42%) individuals. When asked how the alert impacted their actions when prompted to test, 27 (53%) answered that they isolated themselves at the time of receiving the alert to test. When asked if immediate return of test results would have impacted their care seeking, 31 (61%) answered that they would not have done anything differently, whereas 13 (25%) would have been more likely to isolate themselves (

Discussion
----------
Our results show the feasibility of a decentralised acute respiratory infection monitoring platform and some of the potential barriers that should be overcome to improve participant engagement and participant-generated data quality. The platform was designed for patients at risk of acute respiratory infections, with early alerts for possible infection through self-reported symptoms and wearable technology. Home diagnostic testing became mainstream during the COVID-19 pandemic,
Although we showed that such a decentralised monitoring platform is feasible, we also uncovered many barriers that need to be overcome before a similar approach can be deployed on a larger scale. First, just half of participants self-tested after receiving an alert to do so, despite the study enrolling from what would be regarded as an engaged population, as participants were already members of the DETECT study and actively responded to outreach. Second, among participants in groups 1 and 2 who tested after receiving an alert, around 30% had invalid test results, a level that is higher than expected and was not anticipated in an at-home test setting. Third, almost as many people self-tested without receiving an alert as did after receiving an alert. This suggests that digitally shared instructions were inadequate to assure that all study participants understood the study purpose and methodology. It is also possible that some participants did not report the presence of symptoms. Further studies are needed to investigate whether providing information in a different format could drive greater comprehension. In addition, we hoped to connect home testing with real-world health-care procedures through connection to each participantâs electronic health records. Although 238 (53%) participants did have a documented encounter within the health-care system of their connected electronic health record since enrolment in the study, it was difficult to passively confirm an association between symptomatic episodes documented in the trial and whether they were tied to a specific electronic health record encounter.
Symptoms were reported in slightly less than a third of participants who received an alert due to physiological changes detected via their wearable device. Considering the early stages of development of the proposed symptom reporting system, which requires the reporting of two symptoms to minimise false-positive alerts, and the potential for recall bias in reporting of symptoms, this finding is still encouraging. However, less than a quarter of people in group 1 who received a physiological alert, performed the at-home test when prompted. One potential explanation for this is that the physiological alert could occur at any time, triggering a notification at a time that might make it easy to disregard. Conversely, about 60% of participants in groups 1 and 2 who received a symptom alert self-tested, which might be because symptom-based alerts occurred only while the participant was on the app reporting symptoms, and receipt of a notification while using the app prompted testing.
An encouraging finding was that the use of the provided wearable devices in our trial was higher than expected, with 81% of participants using the device consistently throughout the trial. The prospect of using wearable sensor data to enable earlier, potentially presymptomatic alerting has been studied,
The DETECT-AHEAD trial builds on DETECTâs digital platform to collect data and provide information to participants about COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. The DETECT study, like most bring-your-own-device studies, could lead to enrolment of non-representative populations and risk contributing to health disparities.
The DETECT-AHEAD trial tested the feasibility of a decentralised monitoring platform for patients with acute respiratory infections that could potentially benefit both clinical research and the public health response against future pandemics. Despite the use of multiple digital health innovations to diagnose acute respiratory infections early, these devices and their potential to serve as supplemental public health tools currently lack the infrastructure needed to support them.
In the DETECT-AHEAD trial, we showed the feasibility of a decentralised monitoring platform for the detection of people who might develop an acute respiratory infection by showing the successful, entirely digital recruitment of 450 participants, with a majority being from UBR populations. Of these participants, 39% were alerted by our algorithm, and 99% had at least one electronic health record entry assessed. We believe that the decentralised format of this trial lays the groundwork for future at-home testing studies, including participant-provided wearable data and self-reported symptoms, and for closing the loop by returning information back to the participant. The use of a novel, low-touch, and decentralised format is pragmatic and allows both a representative study population and electronic health record data linkage. Nonetheless, a good deal of refinement is needed before the conduct of large, pragmatic clinical trials using these relatively inexpensive remote monitoring technologies.
