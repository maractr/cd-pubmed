Title: Digitizing Survivorship Care Plans Through the POST-Treatment Health Outcomes of Cancer Survivors (POSTHOC) Mobile App: Protocol for a Phase II Randomized Controlled Trial

Abstract: Survivorship care plans (SCPs) are provided at the completion of cancer treatment to aid in the transition from active treatment to long-term survivorship. They describe the details of a patientâs diagnosis and treatment and offer recommendations for follow-up appointments, referrals, and healthy behaviors. The plans are currently paper-based and become outdated as soon as a patientâs health status changes. There is a need to digitize these plans to improve their accessibility, modifiability, and longevity. With current technology, SCPs can be linked to mobile devices and activity trackers so that patients can track health behaviors and compare them to their clinical goals, taking charge of their own health. A mobile app, POSTHOC (POST-Treatment Health Outcomes of Cancer Survivors), that digitizes the SCP was developed, with goals of integrating it with wearable technologies and electronic medical records. Herein, we are conducting a randomized controlled trial that evaluates the POSTHOC app versus the traditional SCP on total symptom burden in the early posttreatment period. We will recruit 54 patients who have recently completed curative therapy for cancer (any type) in person and remotely. They will be randomized 2:1, POSTHOC:usual care (unblinded). Those randomized to the POSTHOC group will receive their SCP via the app and will choose to focus on nutrition or exercise for the duration of the study based on their individual plan and personal preferences. Those randomized to the control group will get a paper-based plan. At baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks, we will evaluate patient-reported outcomes, including total symptom burden (web-based questionnaire), diet (24-hour Automated Self-Administered [ASA24]), and physical activity (Fitbit Charge 6 [Google LLC]). We will also collect quantitative and qualitative feedback on the usability of the app from those in the POSTHOC arm to improve the app for future implementation studies, with a specific focus on patient-provider communication. For feasibility, we will calculate the percentage of patients who used the POSTHOC app at least 3 times per week. We will use linear mixed models to evaluate the effects of the POSTHOC app versus those of usual care on other outcomes at weeks 6 and 12. This trial is open to accrual in the University of Maryland Medical System as of March 2024, and as of July 3, 2024, a total of 20 participants have consented. This study is among the first to digitize the SCP in a mobile app and test the effects of a mobile healthâdelivered behavioral health intervention on symptom burden in cancer survivors. Our results will provide evidence about the effects of health self-management on symptoms. This knowledge will be integral to larger randomized controlled studies, integration with the electronic medical record, and nationwide implementation.

This Study
----------
This study will fill a significant gap in the literature by being the first study, to our knowledge, to both digitize the SCP in a mobile app integrated with a wearable activity tracker and test the effects of the app on symptom burden in cancer survivors. We hypothesize that (1) the POSTHOC (POST-Treatment Health Outcomes of Cancer Survivors; Charles River Analytics) app is feasible, acceptable, and useful for cancer survivors; (2) the POSTHOC app will reduce cumulative symptom burden reported by patients compared to usual care; and (3) the POSTHOC app will improve health behaviors compared to usual care, as measured by patient-reported physical activity. The results of this study will be built upon to improve the usefulness of the app and integrate it into clinical workflow.

Methods
-------
Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center (UMGCCC) Clinical Research Center (GCCC2280), the University of Maryland School of Nursing Office of Research and Scholarship (HP-00100473), the University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB) Institutional Review Board (HP-00100473), and 4 community oncology practices in the University of Maryland Medical System. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05499663). All participants will provide informed consent (see 
Because the SCP includes protected health information, we are ensuring the safety of the data using several layers of security. First, the SCP includes minimal protected health information that could be used in a security breach; it does not include name, birthday, address, phone number, email address, or medical record number. Second, the SparkCare platform, which houses the POSTHOC app and the PostgreSQL database, is installed on UMB servers managed using Azure (Microsoft Corp) services, so data are not transferred to or from Charles River Analytics or anywhere other than the participantsâ personal smartphones. Third, we installed an Internet Information Services (Microsoft Corp) webserver; obtained a public IP address, domain name, and security certificate; and configured a domain name system. The POSTHOC app is not publicly available and can be accessed only via an internal developer link that can be opened only via an invitation (via Test Flight for Apple users).
The POSTHOC app also has a âclinician portalâ on a dual authenticationâprotected website. The clinician portal allows study team members to invite participants, manage participants, assign participants to the POSTHOC or usual care arm, and enter the SCP. Only the study team has access to the study data, although participants may share the data with their provider at their discretion.
The primary aim is to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the POSTHOC app among cancer survivors (randomized to the app group: 36/54, 67%). The secondary aim is to obtain a preliminary estimate of the effect of the POSTHOC app versus usual care on cumulative patient-reported symptom burden (approximately 36/54, 67% in the intervention arm and approximately 18/54, 33% in the usual care arm). The tertiary aim is to obtain a preliminary estimate of the effect of the POSTHOC app versus usual care on patient-reported and objectively measured health behaviors (physical activity, diet, and sleep). Exploratory mechanistic aims are to (1) assess cross-sectional associations between health behaviors (physical activity, diet, and sleep) and cumulative symptom burden at baseline; (2) explore associations between changes in health behaviors (physical activity, diet, and sleep) and cumulative symptom burden from baseline to 6 weeks and from baseline to 12 weeks; and (3) explore associations between adherence to the intervention and changes in the same measuresâsymptoms, physical activity, diet, and sleep.
This study is a phase II feasibility and preliminary efficacy, parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial conducted via the University of Maryland School of Nursing. Recruitment will occur at the University of Maryland Medical System cancer centers, including the UMGCCC in Baltimore, Maryland; the Cancer Center at University of Maryland (UM) Shore Regional Health in Easton, Maryland; the Cancer Institute at UM St. Joseph Medical Center in Towson, Maryland; the Kaufman Cancer Center at UM Upper Chesapeake Health in Bel Air, Maryland; and the Tate Cancer Center at UM Baltimore Washington Medical Center in Glen Burnie, Maryland. We will recruit 54 cancer survivors at an expected recruitment rate of 3 to 5 participants per month for 12 to 18 months.
Potential participants will be identified using four methods: (1) screening medical records, (2) direct referral from providers (eg, nurses, nurse navigators, and physicians), (3) flyers, and (4) advertising via standard UMB networks (eg, ResearchMatch). After a potential participant has shown an initial interest in the study, the study team will review eligibility and send the consent form, which includes a detailed discussion of the study activities (see 
To be eligible for the study, participants must (1) be aged â¥18 years; (2) have had a cancer diagnosis (any type); (3) soon complete treatment or have recently completed treatment (within the past 12 weeks) with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery with curative intent; (4) have received, plan to receive, or be open to receiving an SCP as per their provider; (5) have access to a device capable of running the POSTHOC app and Fitbit [Google LLC] app (eg, Android [Google LLC] or Apple [Apple, Inc] smartphone) and reliable internet access; (6) be able to read and understand English; and (7) be able to provide written informed consent. Participants must not have planned surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy during the study period (hormonal and biological therapy is allowed). Digital literacy is an implicit 
Participation is voluntary, and all participants are free to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. For example, if someone becomes ineligible for the study after they consent or if they have recurrence or a surgery planned while they are on study, they will not be withdrawn from the study unless their clinical care team feels that withdrawal is the most appropriate decision.
All study activities can be done remotely, and there is no essential face-to-face interaction between the study team and the participant (
In addition, during baseline, participants will complete an On-Study form that includes questions on demographics and clinical characteristics and baseline questionnaires (approximately 35-50 minutes) via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; version 13.7.4; Vanderbilt University). Participants will wear the activity tracker for 7 days to assess physical activity and sleep. We will also conduct EMAs via the POSTHOC app for these 7 days, during which participants will be prompted to answer 5 questions 4 times per day; the default times will be 9 AM, 12:30 PM, 4 PM, and 7:30 PM but can be adjusted based on the participantâs schedule and preferences (ideally begin 1 to 2 hours after waking; 
Study schema. In this randomized controlled trial, participants will first consent and download the POSTHOC (POST-Treatment Health Outcomes of Cancer Survivors) and Fitbit apps. After baseline assessments, they will be randomized and be in the study phase for 12 weeks. Our team will contact all participants at least every 2 weeks, and assessments will occur at weeks 6 and 12. We will then conduct an exit interview to solicit qualitative feedback on the app and the study.
Screenshots of the POSTHOC (POST-Treatment Health Outcomes of Cancer Survivors) app. (A) The home screen for participants randomized to the POSTHOC arm of the clinical trial. Here, participants see whether they have recorded any symptoms and any dietary data they have entered. Steps, minutes of moderate and vigorous exercise, and sleep data are pulled from the Fitbit app. A green check indicates whether the goal was met for the day. Participants may navigate to the survivorship care plan (SCP; âMy Care Planâ), Settings (gear in the top right), Symptoms, and Nutrition from here. (B) The SCP is divided into 6 sections based on the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) template for SCPs, survivorship guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and the University of Maryland Medical Systemâs SCP template. (C) Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is administered 4 times per day for 7 days at baseline, week 6, and week 12. While the SCP will be manually entered into the POSTHOC app for this trial, it is an ultimate goal to interface the platform with the medical record so that the plan can be updated as a personâs health and goals change.
We will use a computer-generated table with random blocks of 3 and 6 and stratify based on whether the participant had chemotherapy or not (yes or no) because symptoms and side effects of chemotherapy versus radiation tend to differ. The randomization table was generated by the statistician, SZ, and is stored in the REDCap database; allocation is concealed from the study staff who will be recruiting and randomizing the participants. After baseline data collection, participants will be randomized 2:1 to the POSTHOC app group (~36/54, 67%) versus the control group (18/54, 33%) in REDCap.
If a participant is randomized to the intervention arm, a member of the study staff will switch them to the âintervention armâ in the clinician portal, and they will have full access to all the features of the app (
Comparison of tools available to the intervention and control groups through the POSTHOC
Participants who choose to focus on exercise will be encouraged but not required to use their activity tracker during weeks 1 to 5 and 7 to 11 so that they can monitor their daily activity against their goals more easily. Over the course of the 12-week intervention, patients will gradually build up to goals laid out in the American College of Sports Medicine Physical Activity Guidelines for Cancer Survivors [
Participants who choose to focus on nutrition will be encouraged to answer brief questions at the end of each day regarding their intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and sweets to compare their eating habits to their goals in the POSTHOC app on a daily basis (Table S1 in 
In the control arm, participants will keep the âlightâ version of the POSTHOC app that has minimal data collection features (
To match expectation effects across the 2 study arms, all participants will be told that we are testing a new app and that we are studying symptoms in early posttreatment survivorship. However, we will avoid the use of terms such as âcontrol groupâ and âintervention group.â We will emphasize the importance of all participantsâ data because we do not know much about the relationships between healthy lifestyle behaviors (eg, nutrition, physical activity, and sleep) and symptoms in early posttreatment survivorship.
For both arms, a member of the study team will call each participant approximately once every 2 weeks for the 12 weeks to encourage engagement; monitor adverse events; and, as appropriate, get feedback on the usability of the app (
Data collection table.
The POSTHOC app was designed by Charles River Analytics specifically for this project (screenshots in 
The app was designed to (1) store information from the SCP, including information about diagnosis, treatments, and future plans and (2) collect data regarding ongoing health status, as it pertains to the SCP (eg, nutrition, physical activity, sleep habits, and symptoms). Data will be collected through a combination of manual entry and automatic collection by the Fitbit activity tracker that we will provide. All data collected by the POSTHOC app (ie, physical activity, diet, and EMA data) will be stored on a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)âcompliant server at UMB.
Physical activity and sleep will be measured via a Fitbit Charge 6, which will be given at no cost to the participants. They will be asked to wear the Fitbit for 7 days during weeks 0 (baseline), 6, and 12. Dietary intake will be assessed using the ASA24 Dietary Assessment Tool [
EMA will be collected via the POSTHOC app 4 times throughout the day for 7 days at weeks 0, 6, and 12. The app will alert the participant to report the severity of 4 common symptoms, namely pain, distress, fatigue, numbness or tingling, and the interference of symptoms with daily activity on a scale of 0 to 10. While research studies have shown success with this type of data collection [
Questionnaires will be administered via REDCap [
Responses to questionnaires (eg, On Study), as well as the Clinical Record Form, will be collected via REDCap and, therefore, will be stored on UMB servers. Charles River Analytics will not have access to any of the data collected in this study.


On Study: this form contains questions on demographics; clinical characteristics; and how much participants think the app, exercise, and healthy eating could help reduce any symptoms they are experiencing. This is a custom questionnaire that should take 5 to 10 minutes to complete.
MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) [
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness TherapyâFatigue (FACIT-F) [
Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI [
Brief Pain InventoryâShort Form (BPI-SF) [
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) [
Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) [
Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy-20 (CIPN-20) [
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognition (FACT-Cog) [
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [
Distress Thermometer (DT) [
Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ) [
Health Care Utilization survey (6 and 12 weeks only): here, we will inquire about any medical appointments (scheduled or unscheduled), hospitalizations, out-of-pocket health care expenses, and whether any of the events were cancer related.
Acceptability survey (6 weeks and postintervention interview only): we will ask 6 questions to gather feedback about how much the participant liked the app, what features they enjoy or do not use, and whether they would recommend the app to others.
System Usability Scale (SUS) [
After the completion of the study (or earlier if a participant withdraws early from the study), a member of the study team will conduct an exit interview to understand the participantsâ experience of being in the study. We will ask them whether they think the app was helpful for alleviating their symptoms and improving their health behaviors. We will ask them what they liked about the study, what they did not like about it, what features they liked or did not like about the POSTHOC app (for those in the intervention arm), whether they would recommend the study to others, etc. To get more information regarding patient-provider communication, we will ask about the number and quality of conversations regarding physical activity and diet between a patient and their provider or providers, as well as questions to understand patientsâ preferences and expectations in regard to where (eg, clinic or home), when, how often, and with whom (eg, primary care physician or oncologist) patient-provider communication regarding lifestyle behaviors should take place. This semistructured interview will use qualitative methods and will last approximately 30 minutes [
For qualitative analysis, we will use the qualitative descriptive approach [
We will measure adherence to the intervention, retention, requests for data entry, and adherence to the goals of the intervention in relation to what is laid out in the SCP. Retention will be measured based on how many participants complete week-12 questionnaires; we predict that we will have â¥85% retention. Adherence to the study requests will be monitored as the percentage of data points received version requested, which will be different for those in the POSTHOC arm versus the usual care arm and for those in the nutrition group versus exercise group within the POSTHOC arm. We predict that we will have lower response rates in the groups that are asked to contribute more (ie, in terms of daily nutrition entries). Nutrition adherence will be measured with an adherence score calculated at week 6 and week 12 based on participant responses to brief questions asked at the end of each day regarding their intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and sweets. Their score will be compared to goals in the SCP. For those who choose to emphasize exercise, actual physical activity from Fitbit will be compared to physical activity goals outlined by the SCP.
The Clinical Record Form will be completed by the study staff at baseline. It contains questions on demographics, height, weight, current menopausal status, Karnofsky performance status or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, comorbidities (eg, hypertension and diabetes), cancer type, cancer stage, surgical procedures, types and doses of treatments (eg, chemotherapy type and dosing, hormone therapy, and radiotherapy regimen), most recent blood work (eg, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and lymphocytes), other medications, and medical history (eg, prior myocardial infarction).
At weeks 6 and 12, a member of the study team will record Health Care Utilization, including the number of unplanned medical encounters such as emergency department, urgent care, oncologist, and primary care visits over the previous 6 weeks (approximately 1 and a half months). At week 12, we will note the provider-rated Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status (or equivalent).
We will capture patient-reported data electronically using the POSTHOC app and REDCap [
We will facilitate the completion of all measures. The reasons for missing data will be tabulated according to the treatment group (via interview, if possible), and participants who dropped out will be compared with those who completed the study with regard to demographic and disease characteristics. The mechanism of missing data will be assessed to select an appropriate statistical method [
Power calculations were based on data from a prior single-arm pilot study that we conducted among a similar group of cancer survivors (National Institutes of Health project 75N91019C00026). Results from this analysis of covariance suggested a pre-post correlation of 0.65 [
The primary outcome is the feasibility of the POSTHOC app, which will be determined by calculating the percentage of patients with cancer in the POSTHOC group that used the app at least 3 times per week. We hypothesize that at least 75% (â¥27/36) of patients will view or log data in the app at least 3 times per week at weeks 6 and 12.
The statistician cannot be blinded due to the 2:1 randomization scheme.
Aim 1 assesses feasibility, acceptability, and usability. For feasibility, we will calculate the percentage of patients who used the POSTHOC app at least 3 times per week, as explained earlier. For acceptability, at weeks 6 and 12, we will estimate the percentage of patients who (1) found the app useful (â¥4 on a scale of 1 to 7), (2) would recommend it to others (â¥4 on a scale of 1 to 7), and (3) would use the app in the future (at least monthly). For usability, we will calculate summary statistics based on an overall usability score from the System Usability Scale (score range 0-100) [
Aim 2 assesses the effects of the intervention versus control on cumulative symptom burden. Our data from aim 2 will provide estimated effect sizes to inform the sample size of a confirmatory phase III randomized controlled trial, per clinical trial guidelines [
Aim 3 will evaluate the effects of the intervention on physical activity (steps and time engaged in moderate and vigorous physical activity) and nutrition (ASA24 scores and daily habits). Similar linear mixed models will evaluate the effects of the POSTHOC app versus usual care on other outcomes at week 6 and week 12. To evaluate the longitudinal trajectory of each outcome, we will use repeated measures linear mixed models incorporating the specific outcome at all 3 time points and using a linear contrast to test the effects of study arm.
Exploratory outcome analyses will include a test of mediation and moderation effects of the POSTHOC app by physical activity adherence, sex, age, etc on outcomes [

Participants who choose to focus on exercise will be encouraged but not required to use their activity tracker during weeks 1 to 5 and 7 to 11 so that they can monitor their daily activity against their goals more easily. Over the course of the 12-week intervention, patients will gradually build up to goals laid out in the American College of Sports Medicine Physical Activity Guidelines for Cancer Survivors [
Participants who choose to focus on nutrition will be encouraged to answer brief questions at the end of each day regarding their intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and sweets to compare their eating habits to their goals in the POSTHOC app on a daily basis (Table S1 in 
In the control arm, participants will keep the âlightâ version of the POSTHOC app that has minimal data collection features (
To match expectation effects across the 2 study arms, all participants will be told that we are testing a new app and that we are studying symptoms in early posttreatment survivorship. However, we will avoid the use of terms such as âcontrol groupâ and âintervention group.â We will emphasize the importance of all participantsâ data because we do not know much about the relationships between healthy lifestyle behaviors (eg, nutrition, physical activity, and sleep) and symptoms in early posttreatment survivorship.
For both arms, a member of the study team will call each participant approximately once every 2 weeks for the 12 weeks to encourage engagement; monitor adverse events; and, as appropriate, get feedback on the usability of the app (

Recruitment, Screening, and Baseline Data Collection
----------------------------------------------------
Potential participants will be identified using four methods: (1) screening medical records, (2) direct referral from providers (eg, nurses, nurse navigators, and physicians), (3) flyers, and (4) advertising via standard UMB networks (eg, ResearchMatch). After a potential participant has shown an initial interest in the study, the study team will review eligibility and send the consent form, which includes a detailed discussion of the study activities (see 
To be eligible for the study, participants must (1) be aged â¥18 years; (2) have had a cancer diagnosis (any type); (3) soon complete treatment or have recently completed treatment (within the past 12 weeks) with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery with curative intent; (4) have received, plan to receive, or be open to receiving an SCP as per their provider; (5) have access to a device capable of running the POSTHOC app and Fitbit [Google LLC] app (eg, Android [Google LLC] or Apple [Apple, Inc] smartphone) and reliable internet access; (6) be able to read and understand English; and (7) be able to provide written informed consent. Participants must not have planned surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy during the study period (hormonal and biological therapy is allowed). Digital literacy is an implicit 
Participation is voluntary, and all participants are free to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. For example, if someone becomes ineligible for the study after they consent or if they have recurrence or a surgery planned while they are on study, they will not be withdrawn from the study unless their clinical care team feels that withdrawal is the most appropriate decision.
All study activities can be done remotely, and there is no essential face-to-face interaction between the study team and the participant (
In addition, during baseline, participants will complete an On-Study form that includes questions on demographics and clinical characteristics and baseline questionnaires (approximately 35-50 minutes) via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; version 13.7.4; Vanderbilt University). Participants will wear the activity tracker for 7 days to assess physical activity and sleep. We will also conduct EMAs via the POSTHOC app for these 7 days, during which participants will be prompted to answer 5 questions 4 times per day; the default times will be 9 AM, 12:30 PM, 4 PM, and 7:30 PM but can be adjusted based on the participantâs schedule and preferences (ideally begin 1 to 2 hours after waking; 
Study schema. In this randomized controlled trial, participants will first consent and download the POSTHOC (POST-Treatment Health Outcomes of Cancer Survivors) and Fitbit apps. After baseline assessments, they will be randomized and be in the study phase for 12 weeks. Our team will contact all participants at least every 2 weeks, and assessments will occur at weeks 6 and 12. We will then conduct an exit interview to solicit qualitative feedback on the app and the study.

Here, participants see whether they have recorded any symptoms and any dietary data they have entered. Steps, minutes of moderate and vigorous exercise, and sleep data are pulled from the Fitbit app. A green check indicates whether the goal was met for the day. Participants may navigate to the survivorship care plan (SCP; âMy Care Planâ), Settings (gear in the top right), Symptoms, and Nutrition from here.

(C) Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is administered 4 times per day for 7 days at baseline, week 6, and week 12. While the SCP will be manually entered into the POSTHOC app for this trial, it is an ultimate goal to interface the platform with the medical record so that the plan can be updated as a personâs health and goals change.

Randomization
-------------
We will use a computer-generated table with random blocks of 3 and 6 and stratify based on whether the participant had chemotherapy or not (yes or no) because symptoms and side effects of chemotherapy versus radiation tend to differ. The randomization table was generated by the statistician, SZ, and is stored in the REDCap database; allocation is concealed from the study staff who will be recruiting and randomizing the participants. After baseline data collection, participants will be randomized 2:1 to the POSTHOC app group (~36/54, 67%) versus the control group (18/54, 33%) in REDCap.

Delivery of the Intervention
----------------------------
If a participant is randomized to the intervention arm, a member of the study staff will switch them to the âintervention armâ in the clinician portal, and they will have full access to all the features of the app (

The POSTHOC App
---------------
The POSTHOC app was designed by Charles River Analytics specifically for this project (screenshots in 
The app was designed to (1) store information from the SCP, including information about diagnosis, treatments, and future plans and (2) collect data regarding ongoing health status, as it pertains to the SCP (eg, nutrition, physical activity, sleep habits, and symptoms). Data will be collected through a combination of manual entry and automatic collection by the Fitbit activity tracker that we will provide. All data collected by the POSTHOC app (ie, physical activity, diet, and EMA data) will be stored on a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)âcompliant server at UMB.

Outcome Measures
----------------
Physical activity and sleep will be measured via a Fitbit Charge 6, which will be given at no cost to the participants. They will be asked to wear the Fitbit for 7 days during weeks 0 (baseline), 6, and 12. Dietary intake will be assessed using the ASA24 Dietary Assessment Tool [
EMA will be collected via the POSTHOC app 4 times throughout the day for 7 days at weeks 0, 6, and 12. The app will alert the participant to report the severity of 4 common symptoms, namely pain, distress, fatigue, numbness or tingling, and the interference of symptoms with daily activity on a scale of 0 to 10. While research studies have shown success with this type of data collection [
Questionnaires will be administered via REDCap [
Responses to questionnaires (eg, On Study), as well as the Clinical Record Form, will be collected via REDCap and, therefore, will be stored on UMB servers. Charles River Analytics will not have access to any of the data collected in this study.

After the completion of the study (or earlier if a participant withdraws early from the study), a member of the study team will conduct an exit interview to understand the participantsâ experience of being in the study. We will ask them whether they think the app was helpful for alleviating their symptoms and improving their health behaviors. We will ask them what they liked about the study, what they did not like about it, what features they liked or did not like about the POSTHOC app (for those in the intervention arm), whether they would recommend the study to others, etc. To get more information regarding patient-provider communication, we will ask about the number and quality of conversations regarding physical activity and diet between a patient and their provider or providers, as well as questions to understand patientsâ preferences and expectations in regard to where (eg, clinic or home), when, how often, and with whom (eg, primary care physician or oncologist) patient-provider communication regarding lifestyle behaviors should take place. This semistructured interview will use qualitative methods and will last approximately 30 minutes [
For qualitative analysis, we will use the qualitative descriptive approach [
We will measure adherence to the intervention, retention, requests for data entry, and adherence to the goals of the intervention in relation to what is laid out in the SCP. Retention will be measured based on how many participants complete week-12 questionnaires; we predict that we will have â¥85% retention. Adherence to the study requests will be monitored as the percentage of data points received version requested, which will be different for those in the POSTHOC arm versus the usual care arm and for those in the nutrition group versus exercise group within the POSTHOC arm. We predict that we will have lower response rates in the groups that are asked to contribute more (ie, in terms of daily nutrition entries). Nutrition adherence will be measured with an adherence score calculated at week 6 and week 12 based on participant responses to brief questions asked at the end of each day regarding their intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and sweets. Their score will be compared to goals in the SCP. For those who choose to emphasize exercise, actual physical activity from Fitbit will be compared to physical activity goals outlined by the SCP.
The Clinical Record Form will be completed by the study staff at baseline. It contains questions on demographics, height, weight, current menopausal status, Karnofsky performance status or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, comorbidities (eg, hypertension and diabetes), cancer type, cancer stage, surgical procedures, types and doses of treatments (eg, chemotherapy type and dosing, hormone therapy, and radiotherapy regimen), most recent blood work (eg, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and lymphocytes), other medications, and medical history (eg, prior myocardial infarction).
At weeks 6 and 12, a member of the study team will record Health Care Utilization, including the number of unplanned medical encounters such as emergency department, urgent care, oncologist, and primary care visits over the previous 6 weeks (approximately 1 and a half months). At week 12, we will note the provider-rated Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status (or equivalent).

We will facilitate the completion of all measures. The reasons for missing data will be tabulated according to the treatment group (via interview, if possible), and participants who dropped out will be compared with those who completed the study with regard to demographic and disease characteristics. The mechanism of missing data will be assessed to select an appropriate statistical method [
Power calculations were based on data from a prior single-arm pilot study that we conducted among a similar group of cancer survivors (National Institutes of Health project 75N91019C00026). Results from this analysis of covariance suggested a pre-post correlation of 0.65 [
The primary outcome is the feasibility of the POSTHOC app, which will be determined by calculating the percentage of patients with cancer in the POSTHOC group that used the app at least 3 times per week. We hypothesize that at least 75% (â¥27/36) of patients will view or log data in the app at least 3 times per week at weeks 6 and 12.

Aim 1 assesses feasibility, acceptability, and usability. For feasibility, we will calculate the percentage of patients who used the POSTHOC app at least 3 times per week, as explained earlier. For acceptability, at weeks 6 and 12, we will estimate the percentage of patients who (1) found the app useful (â¥4 on a scale of 1 to 7), (2) would recommend it to others (â¥4 on a scale of 1 to 7), and (3) would use the app in the future (at least monthly). For usability, we will calculate summary statistics based on an overall usability score from the System Usability Scale (score range 0-100) [
Aim 2 assesses the effects of the intervention versus control on cumulative symptom burden. Our data from aim 2 will provide estimated effect sizes to inform the sample size of a confirmatory phase III randomized controlled trial, per clinical trial guidelines [
Aim 3 will evaluate the effects of the intervention on physical activity (steps and time engaged in moderate and vigorous physical activity) and nutrition (ASA24 scores and daily habits). Similar linear mixed models will evaluate the effects of the POSTHOC app versus usual care on other outcomes at week 6 and week 12. To evaluate the longitudinal trajectory of each outcome, we will use repeated measures linear mixed models incorporating the specific outcome at all 3 time points and using a linear contrast to test the effects of study arm.

Results
-------
This project was funded by the National Cancer Institute in September 2021. Approval from the Institutional Review Board at the UMB was obtained on February 21, 2024, and the trial was opened to accrual on March 1, 2024. As of July 3, 2024, a total of 20 participants have been enrolled. We expect to complete enrollment in fall 2024, complete data collection in winter 2025, and publish the results in winter 2026.

Discussion
----------
In regard to our first hypothesis that the POSTHOC app is feasible, acceptable, and useful for cancer survivors, we predict that at least 75% (â¥27/36) of participants in the POSTHOC arm will view or log data in the app at least 3 times per week. We also predict that at least 75% (â¥27/36) of patients will enjoy using the app (Likert rating of >3 out of 5) and will recommend it to other patients (yes or no) at weeks 6 and 12. We further expect that participants will find the app useful overall but will suggest areas for improvement. In regard to our second hypothesis that POSTHOC will reduce the cumulative symptom burden reported by patients compared to usual care, we predict that the sum of the 13-item MD Anderson Symptom Inventory will be at least 8.5 points lower for patients in the POSTHOC arm than for patients in the usual care arm. Finally, in regard to our third hypothesis that the POSTHOC app will improve health behaviors compared to usual care, we predict that patients in the POSTHOC arm who choose to focus on exercise will complete at least 500 more steps per day than patients in the usual care arm (but hopefully at least 1000 to 2000 steps more per day than controls), based on our prior studies of exercise in patients with cancer [
The growing population of cancer survivors must cope with symptoms of the disease and side effects of treatment, and current SCPs are not enough to ensure timely symptom identification and adherence to recommendations in the SCPs [
Charles River Analytics completed a phase I project to launch the development of an app called POSTHOC to digitize the SCPs. Specifically, the team conducted targeted interviews with survivors, clinicians, and researchers to understand how providers track symptoms of cancer with their current tools, including the SCP, and what features could be added to the existing tools and workflows to streamline care. Accordingly, the POSTHOC app was designed to go beyond routine plans to deliver an updatable SCP, collect data regarding ongoing health status, and promote healthy lifestyle behaviors. The success of the phase I of the project enabled us to build upon the platform in phase II, which involves the testing of the app in a clinical population regarding feasibility, usability, and preliminary efficacy in reducing symptom burden.
Prior studies with digital SCPs have not used a care planâspecific mobile app, have been underpowered to detect changes in physical activity patterns, or have tended to focus exclusively on exercise interventions rather than nutrition and exercise interventions [
In the near future, the POSTHOC app could help advance the management of postâcancer treatment symptoms with nutrition and exercise interventions. We foresee 3 key benefits to the integration of the POSTHOC app into the clinical workflow. First, the app will be able to gather personalized health information outside the clinicâs walls and provide on-demand, real-time feedback to survivors. A future goal is for the app to be able to interface with medical records to facilitate conversation about health-promoting behaviors between the patient and the clinical care team. These personalized health data permit providers to keep track of emerging symptom patterns and adherence to the SCP and provide support tools as they seek to promote healthy behaviors. Second, the app will provide information and tools to health providers in an easy-to-use format, giving health care professionals unprecedented access to survivor data to guide patient-provider communication and clinical decision-making, including oncologists, primary care physicians, and physical therapists, as we have suggested for treating chemotherapy-induced neuropathy [
It is the ultimate goal for the POSTHOC app to be available to anyone with an Apple or Android smartphone. While the features of the app would remain the same between real-world and research settings, there would be one main difference in the setup: the research team is currently manually entering the SCP into the app for the participant. In the real world, the clinical care team should not be burdened with entering the SCP into a separate app, but the goal would be for the app to interface with the electronic medical record so that the app can automatically fetch the SCP and continuously update as the userâs health status and goals change.
We are prepared to address potential problems that may arise during the implementation of the study. During the recruitment phase, we may have trouble recruiting participants. We will then widen our eligibility criteria and use different advertising strategies, including forming closer relationships with oncologists and advanced practice providers, spending more time with patients in clinics, and advertising among cancer support groups. In the intervention phase, participants may have difficulty understanding the user interface and using the app. We will do our best to provide comprehensive guidelines for use. If necessary, we will offer more opportunities for in-person instructions and weekly tutorials with study team members. In addition, participants may not use the app and answer survey questions regularly. To encourage participants to actively engage with the app whenever possible, we will plan consistent check-ins with study team members. If technical issues arise, a support team from Charles River Analytics get on call to push updates wirelessly and address technological concerns.
This study has several strengths. First, we expect this study to include a diverse sample of participants and have high generalizability to cancer survivors in the United States. In the UMGCCC catchment area, approximately 30% of people identify as Black or African American, compared to 13% of Americans across the United States, and we expect our cohort to reflect our catchment area. Moreover, we will recruit from the cancer center in downtown Baltimore, Maryland, as well as from affiliated community oncology clinics in suburban and rural areas. Second, this study uses EMA and ultrahigh-frequency sampling, with data collected daily during the morning, early afternoon, later afternoon, and evening. The results may offer insights into the interplay of exercise, symptom burden, and circadian effects. They can also be applied to make inferences regarding causality on a small-time scale (ie, throughout the day and day to day). Past studies have either been underpowered to detect daily changes in physical activity or used lower-frequency sampling, asking participants to respond to 1 or 2 daily messages or a set number of prompts within a designated period [
This study also has limitations. First, this is a phase II feasibility and preliminary efficacy study (n=54), and the results should be tested for replication and validation before being implemented into guidelines. Nevertheless, we expect that this work will help lay the groundwork for larger studies to test similar hypotheses. Second, this study includes a usual care control instead of an active control. However, in this context, including a usual care control allows for the most direct evaluation of a mHealth-delivered behavioral intervention in comparison to an mHealth diet and activity tracker. Third, this study collects information primarily from patient-reported outcomes, with no clinical assessments of signs (eg, blood-based biomarkers). However, the data collection methods include digital measures of diet, activity, and sleep, which allow for objective assessments of physical health. Fourth, bias may be introduced into this study in that only people who are comfortable enough with technology to beta-test an app will enroll. Those who enroll and are less comfortable with technology might be more likely to remain in the study if they are in the control group than if they are in the POSTHOC group, but dropout rates should not affect our primary outcome (feasibility, acceptability, and usability, analyzing only data from the POSTHOC arm) or symptom data in aim 2. While we might have POSTHOC participants who do not use the app (nonadherence), it will not be possible for control participants to use the app (contamination) because we have control over what features all the participants can see. Nonadherence will lead to more conservative effect size estimates of the effect of the intervention on symptom burden. Our analyses will be a step toward understanding how we can digitize the SCP into a mobile app to help improve outcomes for posttreatment cancer survivors.
Future initiatives will work to optimize the reach and usefulness of the POSTHOC app, as well as the design and logistics of clinical trials to test the appâs efficacy in alleviating symptom burden. For example, we are working toward allowing the POSTHOC app to interface with the electronic medical record to facilitate conversations about lifestyle behaviors between the patient and the clinical care team. We will also incorporate feedback from participants and clinicians to improve the features of the app to maximize its usability and usefulness for survivors, their caregivers, and their clinical care team.

In regard to our first hypothesis that the POSTHOC app is feasible, acceptable, and useful for cancer survivors, we predict that at least 75% (â¥27/36) of participants in the POSTHOC arm will view or log data in the app at least 3 times per week. We also predict that at least 75% (â¥27/36) of patients will enjoy using the app (Likert rating of >3 out of 5) and will recommend it to other patients (yes or no) at weeks 6 and 12. We further expect that participants will find the app useful overall but will suggest areas for improvement. In regard to our second hypothesis that POSTHOC will reduce the cumulative symptom burden reported by patients compared to usual care, we predict that the sum of the 13-item MD Anderson Symptom Inventory will be at least 8.5 points lower for patients in the POSTHOC arm than for patients in the usual care arm. Finally, in regard to our third hypothesis that the POSTHOC app will improve health behaviors compared to usual care, we predict that patients in the POSTHOC arm who choose to focus on exercise will complete at least 500 more steps per day than patients in the usual care arm (but hopefully at least 1000 to 2000 steps more per day than controls), based on our prior studies of exercise in patients with cancer [

Integration of This Project Into Prior Literature
-------------------------------------------------
The growing population of cancer survivors must cope with symptoms of the disease and side effects of treatment, and current SCPs are not enough to ensure timely symptom identification and adherence to recommendations in the SCPs [
Charles River Analytics completed a phase I project to launch the development of an app called POSTHOC to digitize the SCPs. Specifically, the team conducted targeted interviews with survivors, clinicians, and researchers to understand how providers track symptoms of cancer with their current tools, including the SCP, and what features could be added to the existing tools and workflows to streamline care. Accordingly, the POSTHOC app was designed to go beyond routine plans to deliver an updatable SCP, collect data regarding ongoing health status, and promote healthy lifestyle behaviors. The success of the phase I of the project enabled us to build upon the platform in phase II, which involves the testing of the app in a clinical population regarding feasibility, usability, and preliminary efficacy in reducing symptom burden.
Prior studies with digital SCPs have not used a care planâspecific mobile app, have been underpowered to detect changes in physical activity patterns, or have tended to focus exclusively on exercise interventions rather than nutrition and exercise interventions [

Clinical Implications
---------------------
In the near future, the POSTHOC app could help advance the management of postâcancer treatment symptoms with nutrition and exercise interventions. We foresee 3 key benefits to the integration of the POSTHOC app into the clinical workflow. First, the app will be able to gather personalized health information outside the clinicâs walls and provide on-demand, real-time feedback to survivors. A future goal is for the app to be able to interface with medical records to facilitate conversation about health-promoting behaviors between the patient and the clinical care team. These personalized health data permit providers to keep track of emerging symptom patterns and adherence to the SCP and provide support tools as they seek to promote healthy behaviors. Second, the app will provide information and tools to health providers in an easy-to-use format, giving health care professionals unprecedented access to survivor data to guide patient-provider communication and clinical decision-making, including oncologists, primary care physicians, and physical therapists, as we have suggested for treating chemotherapy-induced neuropathy [
It is the ultimate goal for the POSTHOC app to be available to anyone with an Apple or Android smartphone. While the features of the app would remain the same between real-world and research settings, there would be one main difference in the setup: the research team is currently manually entering the SCP into the app for the participant. In the real world, the clinical care team should not be burdened with entering the SCP into a separate app, but the goal would be for the app to interface with the electronic medical record so that the app can automatically fetch the SCP and continuously update as the userâs health status and goals change.

Potential Problems and Solutions
--------------------------------
We are prepared to address potential problems that may arise during the implementation of the study. During the recruitment phase, we may have trouble recruiting participants. We will then widen our eligibility criteria and use different advertising strategies, including forming closer relationships with oncologists and advanced practice providers, spending more time with patients in clinics, and advertising among cancer support groups. In the intervention phase, participants may have difficulty understanding the user interface and using the app. We will do our best to provide comprehensive guidelines for use. If necessary, we will offer more opportunities for in-person instructions and weekly tutorials with study team members. In addition, participants may not use the app and answer survey questions regularly. To encourage participants to actively engage with the app whenever possible, we will plan consistent check-ins with study team members. If technical issues arise, a support team from Charles River Analytics get on call to push updates wirelessly and address technological concerns.

Strengths and Limitations
-------------------------
This study has several strengths. First, we expect this study to include a diverse sample of participants and have high generalizability to cancer survivors in the United States. In the UMGCCC catchment area, approximately 30% of people identify as Black or African American, compared to 13% of Americans across the United States, and we expect our cohort to reflect our catchment area. Moreover, we will recruit from the cancer center in downtown Baltimore, Maryland, as well as from affiliated community oncology clinics in suburban and rural areas. Second, this study uses EMA and ultrahigh-frequency sampling, with data collected daily during the morning, early afternoon, later afternoon, and evening. The results may offer insights into the interplay of exercise, symptom burden, and circadian effects. They can also be applied to make inferences regarding causality on a small-time scale (ie, throughout the day and day to day). Past studies have either been underpowered to detect daily changes in physical activity or used lower-frequency sampling, asking participants to respond to 1 or 2 daily messages or a set number of prompts within a designated period [
This study also has limitations. First, this is a phase II feasibility and preliminary efficacy study (n=54), and the results should be tested for replication and validation before being implemented into guidelines. Nevertheless, we expect that this work will help lay the groundwork for larger studies to test similar hypotheses. Second, this study includes a usual care control instead of an active control. However, in this context, including a usual care control allows for the most direct evaluation of a mHealth-delivered behavioral intervention in comparison to an mHealth diet and activity tracker. Third, this study collects information primarily from patient-reported outcomes, with no clinical assessments of signs (eg, blood-based biomarkers). However, the data collection methods include digital measures of diet, activity, and sleep, which allow for objective assessments of physical health. Fourth, bias may be introduced into this study in that only people who are comfortable enough with technology to beta-test an app will enroll. Those who enroll and are less comfortable with technology might be more likely to remain in the study if they are in the control group than if they are in the POSTHOC group, but dropout rates should not affect our primary outcome (feasibility, acceptability, and usability, analyzing only data from the POSTHOC arm) or symptom data in aim 2. While we might have POSTHOC participants who do not use the app (nonadherence), it will not be possible for control participants to use the app (contamination) because we have control over what features all the participants can see. Nonadherence will lead to more conservative effect size estimates of the effect of the intervention on symptom burden. Our analyses will be a step toward understanding how we can digitize the SCP into a mobile app to help improve outcomes for posttreatment cancer survivors.

Future Work
-----------
Future initiatives will work to optimize the reach and usefulness of the POSTHOC app, as well as the design and logistics of clinical trials to test the appâs efficacy in alleviating symptom burden. For example, we are working toward allowing the POSTHOC app to interface with the electronic medical record to facilitate conversations about lifestyle behaviors between the patient and the clinical care team. We will also incorporate feedback from participants and clinicians to improve the features of the app to maximize its usability and usefulness for survivors, their caregivers, and their clinical care team.
