Title: Deconstructing Fitbit to Specify the Effective Features in Promoting Physical Activity Among Inactive Adults: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial

Abstract: Wearable activity trackers have become key players in mobile health practice as they offer various behavior change techniques (BCTs) to help improve physical activity (PA). Typically, multiple BCTs are implemented simultaneously in a device, making it difficult to identify which BCTs specifically improve PA. We investigated the effects of BCTs implemented on a smartwatch, the Fitbit, to determine how each technique promoted PA. This study was a single-blind, pilot randomized controlled trial, in which 70 adults (n=44, 63% women; mean age 40.5, SD 12.56 years; closed user group) were allocated to 1 of 3 BCT conditions: self-monitoring (feedback on participantsâ own steps), goal setting (providing daily step goals), and social comparison (displaying daily steps achieved by peers). Each intervention lasted for 4 weeks (fully automated), during which participants wore a Fitbit and responded to day-to-day questionnaires regarding motivation. At pre- and postintervention time points (in-person sessions), levels and readiness for PA as well as different aspects of motivation were assessed. Participants showed excellent adherence (mean valid-wear time of Fitbit=26.43/28 days, 94%), and no dropout was recorded. No significant changes were found in self-reported total PA ( Fitbit-implemented BCTs promote readiness and motivation for PA, although their effects on PA levels are marginal. The BCT-specific effects were unclear, but preliminary evidence showed that self-monitoring alone may be perceived demanding. Combining self-monitoring with another BCT (or goal setting, at least) may be important for enhancing continuous engagement in PA.

Objectives
----------
In summary, we aimed to test the effects of the 3 BCTs implemented using the Fitbit smartwatch to resolve an answered question in the literature, that is, how each BCT would contribute to improvement in PA levels and motivation in the form of mHealth intervention. A 2 Ã 3 factorial design was used, with assessment occasions (pre- vs postintervention time points) as the within-person factor and groups (self-monitoring vs goal setting vs social comparison) as the between-person factor. During the 4-week intervention, participants wore a Fitbit Sense to receive 1 of the 3 interventions (ie, self-monitoring, goal setting, or social comparison) and assess their levels of PA (in the form of step count) for 24 hours. They also responded to daily online questionnaires asking how motivated they were regarding PA. The primary outcome was self-reported PA levels assessed before and after the intervention. The secondary outcomes included (1) the stage of change for PA [

Methods
-------
Invitations were spread to local inhabitants in and around Ibaraki Prefecture (a middle-north region in Japan; February 2023) who had been registered in a database of potential participants. The study was advertised (online) as one that assessed psychological and behavioral data in daily life. The advertisement explicitly stated that participants would be asked to wear the Fitbit for 1 month, but they were blinded to the intervention conditions. In total, 140 individuals were assessed for eligibility, and 70 (50%) met the following inclusion criteria: (1) being aged 18-64 years; (2) expecting no major life change (eg, in a living place or job) before or during the study; (3) being not pregnant or not lactating; (4) being in good health (ie, having no medical, neurological, psychiatric, or other physical illnesses); (5) having not been diagnosed with dysautonomia, depression, mania, bipolar disorder, or facial paralysis in the past; (6) not taking tranquilizers or antihypertensive drugs regularly; (7) not taking hormone replacement therapy or not taking oral contraceptives; and (8) not exercising regularly. Regular PA levels (criterion 8) were assessed using the Stage of Change (SoC) questionnaire for PA (see the 
The sample size was determined after the recommendations of a pilot randomized controlled trial (eg, [
Participants were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups and received a smartphone and a Fitbit Sense at the beginning of the study (briefing session). The Fitbit app was installed on the smartphones with varying settings for each intervention condition.
In the self-monitoring group, participants received a smartphone with the Fitbit app, with all notification functions turned off, except for low battery warnings. Participants were allowed to see the home display, showing the step count of the day and other physiological information, including sleep, heart rate, and skin temperature. However, the app indicated no step goals to achieve, social functions were disabled, and no push notifications were sent to the devices during the intervention period. Participants received a chat message on their smartphone each evening (at 9 PM) asking them to read the step count of the day displayed on the Fitbit and manually record it on an online questionnaire platform.
Participants in the goal setting group were explicitly informed of the goal to be achieved each day (ie, 9000 and 8500 steps for men and women, respectively) by an experimenter during the briefing session. These goals were set according to the Japanese national health recommendations [
The participants in the social comparison group were explicitly instructed to read and record the step counts of their peers on the Fitbit app each evening. On the Fitbit app, 5 peers (called âfriendsâ) had been registered before distribution. Participants were not explicitly told who these friends were, but each friend was displayed on the app with a unique participant ID (eg, AIST_01 and AIST_02). These 5 friends were the researchers and research assistants of this project, who wore the Fitbit Sense throughout the period of data collection. The average step count for the 5 friends was 6405-11,449 steps per day. Each participant was paired with the same 5 friends so that there was no variability in the friendsâ activity levels between participants. We asked participants to check their friendsâ steps each day but did not explicitly ask participants to outperform their friends.
We administered the following three types of assessments: (1) pre- and postintervention assessments in the lab, (2) daily in-intervention assessments at home using self-report scales for motivation, and (3) accelerometry (implemented in Fitbit) for step counts (
Overview of the measures and response items.
Readiness for PA was assessed using the Japanese version [
Total PA was assessed using the International Physical Activity QuestionnaireâShort Form (IPAQ-SF) [
The baseline and postintervention levels of motivation for PA were assessed using the revised version of the Self-determined Motivation Scale for Exercise [
A chat message was sent to the participantsâ smartphones in the evening (at 9 PM). The message included a link to an online survey platform (Exkuma [
Interested participants completed an online screening survey for eligibility. Those identified as eligible were then invited to an online system to schedule an in-person briefing session, where groups of 1-4 participants were formed arbitrarily. These groups were randomly allocated to 1 of the 3 intervention conditions (1:1:1) following a random sequence generated by a trial analyst using R (version 4; R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Experimenters (who conducted the recruitment and assessments) were not involved in this process. Block randomization (batch per group size) was used to prevent imbalances in group allocation. Single blinding was used; participants were not aware of whether they were in an active or control condition or what interventions other participants received. During the briefing session, the participants received instructions about the study, provided informed consent, and completed baseline questionnaires. At the end of this session, the participants received a smartphone (Android OS) paired with a Fitbit Sense. As the data collected via these devices were tagged with participant IDs (but not with their real names), there was no security concerns about personal information.
During the 4-week intervention period, participants were asked to wear a Fitbit Sense on their nondominant wrist for 24 hours. Participants were instructed not to change the settings of the Fitbit app. Each evening, all participants recorded their daily step count on an online questionnaire platform. Those in the social comparison group were also asked to record the highest step count of the day among their friends on the Fitbit app. There was no in-person component in the interventions although technical support (eg, for app login and online questionnaires) was provided by an experimenter at any point of the interventions.
Immediately after the 4-week interventions, the participants were invited to the lab again, returned their smartphones and Fitbit, and completed the postintervention questionnaires. They also took part in a brief in-person interview asking whether participants experienced any adverse events during the intervention period and how they liked Fitbit and each intervention component (ie, self-monitoring, goal setting, or social comparison). At the end of the debriefing session, the participants received 49,000 JPY (US $350) as compensation. Postintervention checks were conducted on the devices right after the interventions were completed. These checks reassured us that (1) the step goals were not changed on the system (8500 or 9000 steps in the goal setting group and no goals in the other 2 groups), and similarly, (2) the friend list was not changed (5 peers in the social comparison group, and no peers in the other 2 groups). The data collection was ended in May 2023.
The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (approval ID: 2022-1240). The protocol was preregistered with the Open Science Framework before data collection.
The primary outcome (ie, self-reported PA level) was analyzed using a 2-level multilevel model with the groups as between-person predictors, time (pre- vs postintervention time points) as the within-person predictor, and cross-level interactions. Groups were dummy coded, with the self-monitoring group as the reference level. Random intercepts and slopes were assumed, which allowed the baseline level of PA and rate of change in PA to vary across individuals. No correlation was assumed between the intercept and the slope. Each model was estimated using the restricted maximum likelihood estimation method. The same or similar models were used for the secondary outcomes. An exception is that the analyses of day-level variables (ie, daily step count and motivations reported each evening) had a continuous time predictor (ie, days since the start of the intervention) instead of pre- and postintervention time points. All randomized participants were included in the analyses on an intention-to-treat basis. The effect sizes (Cohen 
Sensitivity analyses were planned to examine the influences of missingness on (1) the Fitbit-assessed step count and (2) evening levels of motivation for PA. First, for the main analysis on step count, we excluded days with steps <2000 as outliers. This cutoff was determined on the distribution observed in the current data (5.6% [110/1960] of records met <2000 steps). Also, 2000 steps can be reliably regarded as too few given that a daily step count of 5000 is operationalized as a sedentary lifestyle [

Discussion
----------
This study examined the effects of different BCTs implemented in Fitbit on subjective and objective levels of PA as well as motivations for PA. Three BCTs (ie, self-monitoring, goal setting, and social comparison) were offered via the smartwatch for 4 weeks, during which participants lived in their daily lives. Overall, participants showed excellent adherence to the interventions (older participants and those with a child or job showed even better adherence), and there were no dropouts at the end of the interventions. Although we found no significant increase in total PA (as assessed by the IPAQ-SF) or Fitbit-assessed step count, participants reported that the stage progressed typically from precontemplation to contemplation across the 3 BCT conditions. In addition, significant increases were detected in several aspects of motivation (ie, integrated and external regulation), and the day-to-day level of external regulation showed a larger increase in self-monitoring than in goal-setting conditions.
Overall, these results suggest that the effects of Fitbit-delivered BCTs on PA are marginal. There are several possible reasons for the detection of smaller-than-expected effects. First, we used an active control condition (ie, self-monitoring offered by a wearable device), unlike previous trials that compared the presence and absence of an activity tracker [
Our aim was to experimentally investigate the effects of mobile implementations of BCTs, and therefore, we decided to keep each BCT manipulation as simple as possible. However, our implementations might feel too simple compared with the features and functions equipped in commercial PA apps. For example, we set rigid goals for each participant (ie, 8000 or 9500 steps each day), but goal setting theory suggests that goals should be adequate and tailored to the individual skills (ie, doable but challenging) [
We detected significant increases in the levels of integrated and external regulations in the postintervention assessment. These increases were not moderated by the BCT conditions, indicating that each group experienced almost equal increases in the 2 types of regulation. Similarly, day-level external regulation increased over the 4-week interventions, which was qualified by the significant time-group interaction. This interaction suggests that participants in the self-monitoring group experienced a larger increase in external regulation than those in the goal setting group. A cross-sectional survey of the Mexican general population [
These findings should be interpreted with consideration of several important limitations. First, we based the eligibility assessment on a 1-item SoC questionnaire, which is not an optimal screening tool. Approximately one-third of eligible participants were sufficiently active to exceed the national health recommendation (23 METs-h/w) at baseline. In the postintervention interview, some participants reported that they had not been aware of their activity level at eligibility screening but realized how active they were when responding to each item of the IPAQ-SF. Future research should consider a sufficiently detailed eligibility assessment for PA and preferably use an objective measure, such as a pedometer or accelerometer. Second, it was not possible to strictly control how the participants used each Fitbit feature during the intervention period. For example, we did not prevent participants from setting their own step goals, even in the self-monitoring or social comparison conditions. Although we did not detect any significant violations in the log of Fitbit usage, it might be appropriate to add a system to lock or unlock a particular function in the app and device to reduce potential contamination. Third, we did not conduct a follow-up assessment to test whether the intervention effects were maintained even after the end of the intervention. This decision was made because we could not give away the Fitbit, but it would be valid to leave the Fitbit with participants even after the end of the intervention if we wanted to observe a long-lasting follow-up effect. Fourth, during the study period, motivation was rated or reported each night together with the step count of the day. This assessment timing may have influenced how participants responded to the questionnairesâit is possible that people are more motivated for PA during the daytime. However, we decided not to administer multiple questionnaires (eg, in the morning; at random moments) within a day to reduce the burden on participants and to achieve high compliance.
Nevertheless, our results suggest that activity trackers are useful for increasing readiness and motivation for PA, although significant heterogeneity was identified. The addition of goal setting and social comparison potentially enhances step count, and goal setting may prevent feelings of pressure or tension from engaging in PA. However, to fully detect BCT-specific effects, a proper trial (eg, with a larger sample size, longer intervention and assessment periods, and different populations) is warranted. It is difficult to evaluate the effects of each BCT and their complex combinations (eg, [
