Title: Data Collection and Management of mHealth, Wearables, and Internet of Things in Digital Behavioral Health Interventions With the Awesome Data Acquisition Method (ADAM): Development of a Novel Informatics Architecture

Abstract: The integration of health and activity data from various wearable devices into research studies presents technical and operational challenges. The Awesome Data Acquisition Method (ADAM) is a versatile, web-based system that was designed for integrating data from various sources and managing a large-scale multiphase research study. As a data collecting system, ADAM allows real-time data collection from wearable devices through the deviceâs application programmable interface and the mobile appâs adaptive real-time questionnaires. As a clinical trial management system, ADAM integrates clinical trial management processes and efficiently supports recruitment, screening, randomization, data tracking, data reporting, and data analysis during the entire research study process. We used a behavioral weight-loss intervention study (SMARTER trial) as a test case to evaluate the ADAM system. SMARTER was a randomized controlled trial that screened 1741 participants and enrolled 502 adults. As a result, the ADAM system was efficiently and successfully deployed to organize and manage the SMARTER trial. Moreover, with its versatile integration capability, the ADAM system made the necessary switch to fully remote assessments and tracking that are performed seamlessly and promptly when the COVID-19 pandemic ceased in-person contact. The remote-native features afforded by the ADAM system minimized the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on the SMARTER trial. The success of SMARTER proved the comprehensiveness and efficiency of the ADAM system. Moreover, ADAM was designed to be generalizable and scalable to fit other studies with minimal editing, redevelopment, and customization. The ADAM system can benefit various behavioral interventions and different populations.

Introduction
------------
In recent years, the health care industry has focused a considerable amount of attention on wearable devices because of their capabilities in monitoring and collecting clinically relevant information such as heart rate (HR), blood pressure, respiratory rate, sleep, and physical activity [
However, this increasing use of wearable devices in research studies also presents challenges. Managing and analyzing the large amounts of data generated by wearable devices in research studies in real time is not a simple task, especially for research teams without dedicated specialized technical support in wearable data management and data engineering. For example, the Fitbit fitness band, one of the most widely used consumer wearable devices in research, has been used to track steps [
Mobile health (mHealth) methods use advanced interactive technologies for the assessment of behaviors and delivery of digital health interventions, an area of research that is growing rapidly. Typical mHealth systems [
A comprehensive and integrated implementation of a clinical trial management system in addition to wearable and mHealth integrations would allow the tracking of the study based on its specified recruitment needs, guarantee that the study starts and ends on time, make sure the necessary action has been taken at participantsâ specialized milestones, and minimize study costs [

General Design
--------------
The Iterative and Incremental Development model [
The ADAM system was designed to support the entire management of research studies that include the use of commercial wearable devices and smartphone apps, including designing questionnaires and collecting the response data remotely, recruitment, screening, enrollment, data tracking, data monitoring, and data visualization. Those components were developed iteratively in each development cycle until the desired study flow was reached. The ADAM system consists of 3 main components: a mobile app, a portal, and a connection with the APIs of wearable devices.

Architecture
------------
The architecture for the ADAM system is illustrated in 
We implemented ADAM as a system to support the SMARTER trial, which was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of 2 different approaches to a technology-supported (mHealth, wearable, and IoTs) behavioral intervention for weight loss [
Another component of the ADAM system was the ADAM portal, which includes a dashboard for study coordinators to review data and engage study participants. Study coordinators were able to get a birdâs-eye view of all participants in the study, including a map of their geographical locations. The coordinator was also able to view the detailed data of individual participants, including questionnaire data, screening data, randomization status, and real-time wearable device data. The ADAM portal consists of 8 modules: a wearable device module for pulling data from the Fitbit and Nokia servers to the ADAM server; a questionnaire module for designing and collecting questionnaires; a screening and enrollment module for tracking participantsâ status in the study; a study phaseâtracking module for providing a snapshot of the whole study process; a randomization module for study-customized randomization needs to help the interventionist performed the randomization at the baseline visit [

Capabilities
------------
Questionnaire-based assessment is one of the most common methods of data collection in research settings. Therefore, the ADAM portal was designed around this need, from the process of questionnaire and assessment design to the remote delivery of questionnaires. Designing a questionnaire based on the study needs was made simpler for researchers with the inclusion of an easy-to-use, drag-and-drop interface and a library of frequently used question templates. The adaptive questionnaire feature in ADAM was designed to be used by study coordinators and investigators with no need to do programming, with a similar ease of use to that of proprietary solutions such as Qualtrics, but unlike most of these proprietary solutions, ADAM allowed integrations with an mHealth app. The ADAM portal also supported more advanced questionnaire features such as input-type validation, error messages, required field validation, and question branching. After a questionnaire was published in the ADAM portal, depending on the purpose, a public link or a participant-specific private link was generated for study use. Once the participant had answered and submitted this questionnaire via the given link, the ADAM portal automatically formatted the answers, placed time stamps, calculated scores, and triggered any necessary flags and status updates that could be immediately reviewed by the study coordinators. As the ADAM portal was designed to support multiphase study needs, questionnaires could be generated for each study phase while considering different restrictions for each phase, for example, adding certain filtering restrictions in the screening phase for certain criteria in the screening phaseâs questionnaire. This questionnaire module can also be adapted to fit the need for remote participant consent delivery, as the study consent form usually shares the same structure and data requirements as an assessment questionnaire.
The ADAM portal also supported the management of other steps in the research study, which commonly included multiple phases or processes such as recruitment, enrollment, engagement, and retention. For the recruitment phase, the ADAM portal supported a multistep screening process. Each sequential screening step could be triggered by the answers or the calculated scores of the current stepâs screening or assessment questionnaire. It could also support manual evaluation by study coordinators. Once screening decisions had been made, the system automatically moved the eligible participants to the next phase in the ADAM system. This real-time process reduced the study coordinatorsâ manual data review and data calculation workload. It also helped reduce the study cost by improving the overall recruitment processâs efficiency.
For the enrollment and engagement phases, the ADAM portal has a built-in account management system that can assign a unique study-specific ID for each participant for efficient progress tracking while protecting their identifiable information. Furthermore, these IDs can also be used as common IDs linking data coming in from outside sources such as the Fitbit and Nokia APIs. With the benefit of the study-specific ID, the ADAM portal can easily record participantsâ digital footprints within the system and track the milestones and progress of all participants within the study. The portal also provides the study coordinator with access to aggregated data, such as that of important milestones or sorted by group, which is represented in a CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) flow diagram. Such a flow diagram is valuable for study management in 3 aspects: it allows the study coordinator to switch the recruitment effort to a specific group of people during recruitment in cases where a group has a less-than-optimal recruitment rate; it facilitates the adjustment of the speed of recruitment to help make sure the study can start and end on time; and it can monitor the screening process and rate of attrition, which may provide some hints for adjustments that may be needed in screening methods.
For the retention process, the ADAM portal provides a dashboard for showing study-related alerts or flags and participantsâ performance according to the data gathered from wearable devices, the digital scale, and the study app. Using this dashboard, the study coordinators have a near real-time report on whether participants are following the study protocol strictly, in other words, adhering to the study; as a result, they can intervene or take alleviating actions at a point closer to when participants began to show a trend toward lower adherence. This feature also helps to estimate the milestones for participantsâ assessments. Other features are study compensation and remuneration management, which were considered indispensable parts of the ADAM system. Study coordinators used the remuneration feature of the ADAM portal to record all payments made or planned at different time points in the study.
Data synchronization with wearable and IoT devices is one of the key features of the ADAM system. As more people rely on commercially available wearable and IoT devices to get their health data and track their fitness, a growing number of investigators have used this type of off-the-shelf wearable device as part of their studies. This trend indicates the need for a study management system that can integrate IoT and wearable data from multiple providers and vendors. Currently, the ADAM portal provides integration with Fitbit (wearable) and Nokia (IoT), since these companies have the largest market share, a secure authentication process, and stable open APIs. The steps to integrate data from wearables in ADAM from the usersâ (study coordinatorsâ) perspective are made simple. Study coordinators first need to create participant accounts in the ADAM portal and get participantsâ permission and authorization to collect their data from outside APIs. Once ADAM has been granted authorization, data synchronization for the given participant will be scheduled daily. The ADAM portal also supports subscription-based data integration, where any new data that become available in the wearable will trigger synchronization or a data import into the ADAM database in a real-time fashion, although we did not implement this feature in the SMARTER study.
The ADAM system provided randomization by minimization, a more advanced randomization method, which was used to ensure the balance of prognostic factors between treatment groups and set equal treatment allocations [
ADAM adopts Firebase Analytics libraries to anonymously monitor app use and statistics. This part of the data mainly describe the use of the app within a period. The study team can obtain a real-time visualization on the ADAM main page. This information can provide an overview of the app use among all study participants and additional background information for the efficiency of message delivery.

The SMARTER Trial Evaluation Results
------------------------------------
In the SMARTER trial, 1741 unique individuals submitted their phase-1 survey through the ADAM portal; 1248 participants were eligible for the phase-2 screening; 905 participants were eligible for the phase-3 screening; and 591 participants were eligible for the baseline in-person assessment. After the baseline assessment, 502 eligible participants were randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment conditions. During the 12-month study period, 4 participants officially withdrew before their 6-month assessment, and 5 withdrew before the final 12-month assessment, all due to health issues. Even including the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall retention rate for the 6-month assessment was 84.93% (423/498) and for the 12-month assessment was 79.92% (394/493). The ADAM system efficiently coordinated study information and supported the study and study team, especially in a situation of limited human resources and having to work fully remotely. It helped to recruit, screen, maintain, and track all individuals wishing to participate in the study; scheduled more than 1500 in-person assessments; and received 4131 questionnaire answers from the screening process to the study completion. Using the ADAM system allowed us to achieve every milestone in the study and minimize the disruptions by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Discussion
----------
We introduced the architecture and implementation of a data collecting and clinical trial management system called ADAM as a solution to current barriers in clinical or behavioral studies involving wearables, IoT, and mHealth. The ADAM systemâs adoption of the newest available interfaces in integration with multiple wearable devices makes it an attractive choice for behavioral and population-based health intervention studies. Using the ADAM system, the study team in the SMARTER trial no longer needed to switch between different systems or documents when working with study data from diverse sources and avoided most data missingness and data synchronization issues. ADAMâs study management functions supported recruitment, screening, and randomization and helped maintain retention with a dashboard and flagging. In addition, it provided an efficient and manageable environment for study tracking and adjustment as necessary. ADAMâs study flowchart was extensively used in the teamâs weekly meetings and contributed widely to decision-making during the entire study period.
The system evaluations throughout the SMARTER trial indicated that the ADAM system was able to meet most of the data collection and study management demands. However, the ADAM system was not without limitations. The first limitation was not due to the ADAM system per se, but due to the limited availability of open APIs for third-party data collection sources also used in the study; therefore, the ADAM system had issues including all datasets for the study. For example, in the SMARTER trial, study participants needed to complete two 24-hour dietary recalls using the ASA24 system, a dietary assessment tool, at 3 assessment points. We could not directly synchronize the dietary recalls from the ASA24 system with the ADAM system due to the API limitations of the ASA24 platform. This limitation prevented study coordinators from receiving real-time data visualization and data analysis in the ADAM system for ASA24âs data. Therefore, all the data from ASA24 needed to be manually downloaded and uploaded to the ADAM system. Although the ADAM system can integrate more datasets and be an all-in-one data solution for the study, we still need to consider approaches that may have API restrictions or the unavailability of such APIs by different companies and organizations that provide additional data required by the study.
The second limitation to consider is the data missingness and data synchronization issues with Fitbit or Nokia devices. Fitbitâs open web API limits the number of API calls per hour for each participant or Fitbit account to 100. This stringent quota restricted the number of days that we could pull the data from the Fitbit server, as we needed to have at least a single call for each day of data. Furthermore, specifically for the SMARTER trial, we were restricted to pulling data only for the last 7 days. Since we were pulling data from several different areas of Fitbitâs API, such as physical activity data, diary data, and sleep data, it quickly consumed the quota for the API calls. At the same time, from time to time, some Fitbit and Nokia devices experienced issues sending data to the Fitbit server when there were internet or Bluetooth connection problems or participants failed to open the Fitbit or HealthMate app for an extended amount of time. Those situations caused a data transfer delay and ultimately led to data missingness and failed data synchronization in the ADAM system.
Furthermore, the version of ADAM used in the SMARTER trial did not have the capabilities to send emails, SMS text messages, or push notifications. Therefore, the interventionists and study coordinators needed to use different modalities of communication and tools to send emails or SMS text messages to the participants. The next iteration of ADAM will include these capabilities to streamline communications and monitoring within one system, ADAM. This would increase the efficiency and the general ease of using the system in reaching participants as needed.
Finally, the ADAM system is more suitable for digital intervention studies using consumer technologies. If the study is highly dependent on in-clinic assessments using offline tools and closed or proprietary systems, the ADAM system provides a limited benefit since the data may be hard or even impossible to transmit to the ADAM system. In addition, studies that target recruitment groups who are unfamiliar with mobile technology or who have limited access to the internet could experience barriers to the adoption of the ADAM system technology. According to the questionnaires, these groups represent a small portion of potential study participants, but this is an important limitation to consider in future studies that may target these groups. This limitation was not an issue in the SMARTER trial, as the study was designed to exclude participants who were not smartphone users.
To address these limitations, first, we are considering supporting additional, widely used wearable devices. Second, we plan to generalize the study management components and make them easier to set up and adapt to distinct types of study design. However, overall, the ADAM system provides a solution to digitalizing a research study by providing and integrating multiple methods for collecting study data and ensuring an efficient and compliant study process.
